    "input": "Importance of Feature Extraction",
    "output": "Feature extraction is important for several reasons:\nReduced Computation Cost:Raw data, especially from images or large datasets can be very complex. Feature extraction makes this data simpler hence reducing the computational resources needed for processing.\nImproved Model Performance:By focusing on key features, machine learning models can work with more relevant information leading to better performance and more accurate results.\nBetter Insights:Reducing the number of features helps algorithms concentrate on the most important data, eliminating noise and irrelevant information which can lead to deeper insights.\nPrevention of Overfitting:Models with too many features may become too specific to the training data, making them perform poorly on new data. Feature extraction reduces this risk by simplifying the model."
