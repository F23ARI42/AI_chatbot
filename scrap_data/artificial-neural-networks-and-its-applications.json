    "output": "Input Layer:This is where the network receives information. For example, in an image recognition task, the input could be an image.\nHidden Layers:These layers process the data received from the input layer. The more hidden layers there are, the more complex patterns the network can learn and understand. Each hidden layer transforms the data into more abstract information.\nOutput Layer:This is where the final decision or prediction is made. For example, after processing an image, the output layer might decide whether it’s a cat or a dog."

    "output": "ANNs work by learning patterns in data through a process called training. During training, the network adjusts itself to improve its accuracy by comparing its predictions with the actual results.\nLets see how the learning process works:\nInput Layer: Data such as an image, text or number is fed into the network through the input layer.\nHidden Layers: Each neuron in the hidden layers performs some calculation on the input, passing the result to the next layer. The data is transformed and abstracted at each layer.\nOutput Layer: After passing through all the layers, the network gives its final prediction like classifying an image as a cat or a dog.\nThe process ofbackpropagationis used to adjust the weights between neurons. When the network makes a mistake, the weights are updated to reduce the error and improve the next prediction."

    "input": "How do Artificial Neural Networks learn?",
    "output": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) learn by training on a set of data. For example, to teach an ANN to recognize a cat, we show it thousands of images of cats. The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions."

In this network, data flows in one direction from the input layer to the output layer, passing through one or more hidden layers. There are no loops or cycles means the data doesn’t return to any earlier layers. This type of network does not use backpropagation and is mainly used for basic classification and regression tasks."

It include convolutional layers that apply filters to extract important features from the data such as edges or textures. This makes CNNs effective in image and speech recognition as they can identify patterns and structures in complex data."

They are used for classification and regression tasks especially when the data represents an underlying pattern or trend."
