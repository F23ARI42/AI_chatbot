    "input": "Working Adagrad",
    "output": "The primary concept behind Adagrad is the idea of adapting the learning rate based on the historical sum of squared gradients for each parameter. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Adagrad works:\n1. Initialization:Adagrad begins by initializing the parameter values randomly, just like other optimization algorithms. Additionally, it initializes a running sum of squared gradients for each parameter which will track the gradients over time.\n2. Gradient Calculation:For each training step, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters is calculated, just like in standard gradient descent.\n3. Adaptive Learning Rate:The key difference comes next. Instead of using a fixed learning rate, Adagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the accumulated sum of squared gradients.\nThe updated learning rate for each parameter is calculated as follows:\nWhere:\n\\etais the global learning rate (a small constant value)\nG_t​ is the sum of squared gradients for a given parameter up to time stept\nϵis a small value added to avoid division by zero (often set to1e−8)\nHere, the denominator\\sqrt{G_t + \\epsilon}​ grows as the squared gradients accumulate, causing the learning rate to decrease over time which helps to stabilize the training.\n4. Parameter Update:The model's parameters are updated by subtracting the product of the adaptive learning rate and the gradient at each step:\nWhere:\n\\theta_t​ is the current parameter\n\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameter"

    "input": "When to Use Adagrad?",
    "output": "Adagrad is ideal for:\nProblems with sparse data and features like in natural language processing or recommender systems.\nTasks where features have different levels of importance and frequency.\nTraining models that do not require a very fast convergence rate but benefit from a more stable optimization process.\nHowever, if you are dealing with problems where a more constant learning rate is preferable, using variants like RMSProp or Adam might be more appropriate."

  {
    "input": "1. RMSProp(Root Mean Square Propagation):",
    "output": "RMSProp addresses the diminishing learning rate issue by introducing an exponentially decaying average of the squared gradients instead of accumulating the sum. This prevents the learning rate from decreasing too quickly, making the algorithm more effective in training deep neural networks.\nThe update rule for RMSProp is as follows:\nWhere:\nG_tis the accumulated gradient\n\\gammais the decay factor (typically set to 0.9)\n\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)is the gradient\nThe parameter update rule is:"

    "input": "2. AdaDelta",
    "output": "AdaDelta is another modification of Adagrad that focuses on reducing the accumulation of past gradients. It updates the learning rates based on the moving average of past gradients and incorporates a more stable and bounded update rule.\nThe key update for AdaDelta is:\nWhere:\n[\\Delta \\theta]^2_{t}is the running average of past squared parameter updates"

    "output": "Adam combines the benefits of both Adagrad and momentum-based methods. It uses both the moving average of the gradients and the squared gradients to adapt the learning rate. Adam is widely used due to its robustness and superior performance in various machine learning tasks.\nAdam has the following update rules:\nFirst moment estimate (m_t​):\nSecond moment estimate (v_t):\nCorrected moment estimates:\nParameter update:"
