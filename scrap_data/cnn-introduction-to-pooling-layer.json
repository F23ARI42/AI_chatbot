    "input": "Key Factors to Consider for Optimizing Pooling Layer",
    "output": "Pooling Window Size: The size of the pooling window affects the degree of downsampling. A larger window results in more aggressive downsampling but may lose important details.\nStride: The stride determines how much the pooling window moves at each step. A larger stride results in greater dimensionality reduction.\nPadding: In some cases, padding is used to ensure that the pooling operation covers the entire input feature map."
