    "output": "Convolutional Layers:These layers apply convolutional operations to input images using filters or kernels to detect features such as edges, textures and more complex patterns. Convolutional operations help preserve the spatial relationships between pixels.\nPooling Layers:They downsample the spatial dimensions of the input, reducing the computational complexity and the number of parameters in the network. Max pooling is a common pooling operation where we select a maximum value from a group of neighboring pixels.\nActivation Functions:They introduce non-linearity to the model by allowing it to learn more complex relationships in the data.\nFully Connected Layers:These layers are responsible for making predictions based on the high-level features learned by the previous layers. They connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer."

    "output": "Efficiency of CNN can be evaluated using a variety of criteria. Among the most popular metrics are:\nAccuracy:Accuracy is the percentage of test images that the CNN correctly classifies.\nPrecision:Precision is the percentage of test images that the CNN predicts as a particular class and that are actually of that class.\nRecall:Recall is the percentage of test images that are of a particular class and that the CNN predicts as that class.\nF1 Score:The F1 Score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is a good metric for evaluating the performance of a CNN on classes that are imbalanced."

    "output": "1. LeNet:LeNetdeveloped by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in the late 1990s was one of the first successful CNNs designed for handwritten digit recognition. It laid the foundation for modern CNNs and achieved high accuracy on the MNIST dataset which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).\n2. AlexNet:AlexNetis a CNN architecture that was developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton in 2012. It was the first CNN to win the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) a major image recognition competition. It consists of several layers of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The architecture includes five convolutional layers, three pooling layers and three fully connected layers.\n3. Resnet:ResNets (Residual Networks)are designed for image recognition and processing tasks. They are renowned for their ability to train very deep networks without overfitting making them highly effective for complex tasks. It introduces skip connections that allow the network to learn residual functions making it easier to train deep architecture.\n4.GoogleNet:GoogleNetalso known as InceptionNet is renowned for achieving high accuracy in image classification while using fewer parameters and computational resources compared to other state-of-the-art CNNs. The core component of GoogleNet allows the network to learn features at different scales simultaneously to enhance performance.\n5. VGG:VGGsare developed by the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford, it uses small 3x3 convolutional filters stacked in multiple layers, creating a deep and uniform structure. Popular variants like VGG-16 and VGG-19 achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the power of depth in CNNs."
