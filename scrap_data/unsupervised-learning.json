  {
    "input": "1. Collect Unlabeled Data",
    "output": "Gather a dataset without predefined labels or categories.\nExample: Images of various animals without any tags."
  },
  {
    "input": "2. Select an Algorithm",
    "output": "Choose a suitable unsupervised algorithm such as clustering like K-Means, association rule learning like Apriori or dimensionality reduction like PCA based on the goal."
  },
  {
    "input": "3. Train the Model on Raw Data",
    "output": "Feed the entire unlabeled dataset to the algorithm.\nThe algorithm looks for similarities, relationships or hidden structures within the data."
  },
  {
    "input": "4. Group or Transform Data",
    "output": "The algorithm organizes data into groups (clusters), rules or lower-dimensional forms without human input.\nExample: It may group similar animals together or extract key patterns from large datasets."
  },
  {
    "input": "5. Interpret and Use Results",
    "output": "Analyze the discovered groups, rules or features to gain insights or use them for further tasks like visualization, anomaly detection or as input for other models."

    "input": "Unsupervised Learning Algorithms",
    "output": "There are mainly 3 types of Unsupervised Algorithms that are used:"
  },
  {
    "input": "1. Clustering Algorithms",
    "output": "Clusteringis an unsupervised machine learning technique that groups unlabeled data into clusters based on similarity. Its goal is to discover patterns or relationships within the data without any prior knowledge of categories or labels.\nGroups data points that share similar features or characteristics.\nHelps find natural groupings in raw, unclassified data.\nCommonly used for customer segmentation, anomaly detection and data organization.\nWorks purely from the input data without any output labels.\nEnables understanding of data structure for further analysis or decision-making."
  },
  {
    "input": "2. Association Rule Learning",
    "output": "Association rule learningis a rule-based unsupervised learning technique used to discover interesting relationships between variables in large datasets. It identifies patterns in the form of “if-then” rules, showing how the presence of some items in the data implies the presence of others.\nFinds frequent item combinations and the rules connecting them.\nCommonly used in market basket analysis to understand product purchase relationships.\nHelps retailers design promotions and cross-selling strategies."
  },
  {
    "input": "3. Dimensionality Reduction",
    "output": "Dimensionality reductionis the process of decreasing the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining as much of the original information as possible. This technique helps simplify complex data making it easier to analyze and visualize. It also improves the efficiency and performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing noise and computational cost.\nIt reduces the dataset’s feature space from many dimensions to fewer, more meaningful ones.\nHelps focus on the most important traits or patterns in the data.\nCommonly used to improve model speed and reduce overfitting."
  },
  {
    "input": "Applications of Unsupervised learning",
    "output": "Unsupervised learning has diverse applications across industries and domains. Key applications include:\nCustomer Segmentation: Algorithms cluster customers based on purchasing behavior or demographics, enabling targeted marketing strategies.\nAnomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in data, aiding fraud detection, cybersecurity and equipment failure prevention.\nRecommendation Systems: Suggests products, movies or music by analyzing user behavior and preferences.\nImage and Text Clustering: Groups similar images or documents for tasks like organization, classification or content recommendation.\nSocial Network Analysis: Detects communities or trends in user interactions on social media platforms."
  },
  {
    "input": "Advantages",
    "output": "No need for labeled data:Works with raw, unlabeled data hence saving time and effort on data annotation.\nDiscovers hidden patterns: Finds natural groupings and structures that might be missed by humans.\nHandles complex and large datasets: Effective for high-dimensional or vast amounts of data.\nUseful for anomaly detection: Can identify outliers and unusual data points without prior examples."
  },
  {
    "input": "Challenges",
    "output": "Here are the key challenges of unsupervised learning:\nNoisy Data: Outliers and noise can distort patterns and reduce the effectiveness of algorithms.\nAssumption Dependence: Algorithms often rely on assumptions (e.g., cluster shapes) which may not match the actual data structure.\nOverfitting Risk: Overfitting can occur when models capture noise instead of meaningful patterns in the data.\nLimited Guidance: The absence of labels restricts the ability to guide the algorithm toward specific outcomes.\nCluster Interpretability: Results such as clusters may lack clear meaning or alignment with real-world categories.\nSensitivity to Parameters: Many algorithms require careful tuning of hyperparameters such as the number of clusters in k-means.\nLack of Ground Truth: Unsupervised learning lacks labeled data making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of results."
