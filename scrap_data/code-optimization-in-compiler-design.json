    "input": "When to Optimize?",
    "output": "Optimization of the code is often performed at the end of the development stage since it reduces readability and adds code that is used to increase performance."
  },
  {
    "input": "Why Optimize?",
    "output": "Optimizing an algorithm is beyond the scope of the code optimization phase. So the program is optimized. And it may involve reducing the size of the code. So, optimization helps to:\nReduce the space consumed and increases the speed of compilation.\nManually analyzing datasets involves a lot of time. Hence, we make use of software like Tableau for data analysis. Similarly, manually performing the optimization is also tedious and is better done using a code optimizer.\nAn optimized code often promotes re-usability."

  {
    "input": "Types of Code Optimization",
    "output": "The optimization process can be broadly classified into two types:\nMachine Independent Optimization:This code optimization phase attempts to improve theintermediate codeto get a better target code as the output. The part of the intermediate code which is transformed here does not involve any CPU registers or absolute memory locations.\nMachine Dependent Optimization:Machine-dependent optimization is done after thetarget codehas been generated and when the code is transformed according to the target machine architecture. It involves CPU registers and may have absolute memory references rather than relative references. Machine-dependent optimizers put efforts to take maximumadvantageof the memory hierarchy."
