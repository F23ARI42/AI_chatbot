    "input": "Why Use Learning Rate Decay?",
    "output": "Faster Training:By starting with a larger learning rate, the model can make quicker progress early in training. This allows the model to learn the general patterns faster, especially when large weight updates are needed in the initial stages.\nBetter Convergence:As the model approaches the optimal solution, smaller learning rates allow for more precise weight updates. This gradual reduction in the learning rate helps the model fine-tune its parameters, preventing overshooting and ensuring it reaches the best possible solution.\nImproved Generalization:In later stages, the decay helps reduce the risk of overfitting by slowing down the learning process. This more controlled approach helps the model generalize better, ensuring that it performs well not just on the training data but also on unseen data."

    "input": "Working of Learning Rate Decay",
    "output": "Learning rate decay works similarly to driving toward a parking spot. Initially, we drive fast to cover more distance quickly but as we get closer to our destination, we slow down to park more accurately. In machine learning, this concept translates to starting with a larger learning rate to make faster progress in the beginning and then gradually reducing it to fine-tune the model’s weights in the later stages of training.\nThe decay is designed to allow the model to make large, broad adjustments early in training and more delicate adjustments as it approaches the optimal solution. This controlled approach helps the model converge more efficiently without overshooting or getting stuck.\nThere are several methods to implement learning rate decay each with a different approach to how the learning rate decreases over time. Some methods decrease the learning rate in discrete steps while others reduce it more smoothly. The choice of decay method can depend on the task, model and how quickly the learning rate needs to be reduced during training."

Step Decay: In step decay, the learning rate is reduced by a fixed factor after a predetermined number of epochs. This method is simple but effective.\nFormula:lr = lr_{initial} * drop \\;rate^{\\frac{epoch}{step\\;size}}\n2. Exponential Decay: It reduces the learning rate exponentially at each epoch, leading to a smooth decrease.\nFormula:lr = lr_{initial}\\; * \\; e^{-decay\\;rate \\;* \\;epoch}\n3. Inverse Time Decay: A factor inversely proportional to the number of epochs is used to reduce the learning rate through inverse decay.\nFormula:lr = lr_{initial} \\; * \\; \\frac{1}{1 + decay * epoch}\n4. Polynomial Decay: It decreases the learning rate based on a polynomial function of the epoch number. This offers a more controlled reduction over time.\nFormula:lr = lr_{initial} \\; * \\; \\left (  1 - \\frac{epoch}{max\\;epoch}\\right )^{power}"

    "output": "Understanding the mathematical foundation behind learning rate decay helps clarify how the learning rate is adjusted over time. A basic learning rate decay plan can be mathematically represented as follows:\nAssume that the starting learning rate is\\eta_{0}and that the learning rate at epoch t is\\eta_{t}.\nA typical decay schedule for learning rates is based on a constant decay rate\\alphawhere\\alpha \\epsilon (0,1), applied at regular intervals (e.g everynepochs). The formula for this basic decay is:\nWhere:\n\\eta_{t}is the learning rate at epoch t.\n\\eta_{0}is the initial learning rate at the start of training.\n\\alphais the fixed decay rate, typically a small positive value such as 0.1 or 0.01.\nt is the current epoch during training.\nIn this equation:\nThe learning rate\\eta_{t}decreases astincreases, means that as the number of epochs grows, the learning rate becomes smaller.\nThe decay factorαcontrols how quickly the learning rate decreases.\nThe learning rate is reduced by a percentage of its previous value at each epoch which helps the optimization process.\nThis schedule provides the optimization by helping the model to converge more quickly at first with larger learning steps and then fine-tuning in smaller increments as it approaches the local minimum."

Hyperparameter settings or an improper schedule can work against training instead of in favor of it.\nDelayed Convergence:Aggressive learning rate decay can sometimes make the model converge very slowly which could require more training time.\nBy mastering learning rate decay, we can significantly improve our model's training efficiency, stability and generalization, ultimately leading to better performance and more reliable results."
