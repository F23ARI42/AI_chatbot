    "output": "The main goal of Monte Carlo simulation is to use random sampling to estimate the expected value of a functionfover a domainD.\nGiven a functionf(x)and a domainD, the expected valueE[f(x)]can be estimated using the following formula:\nwhere:\nNis the number of random samples.\nx_i​ are the random samples drawn from the domainD.\nMonte Carlo also helps estimate integrals when the exact solution is hard to find. For that, the formula is:\nHere,\\text{volume}(D)adjusts for the size of the domain."

We'll use the classic method of simulating random points inside a unit square and checking how many fall inside a quarter circle.\nHere we will be usingNumpyandMatplotliblibraries for its implementation. Here we will do:\nGenerate Random Points:First, we generate randomxandycoordinates within the unit square (from -1 to 1).\nFind Distance:For each point, we calculate its distance from the origin (0, 0) using the formula:\\text{distance} = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\nCount Points Inside Circle:Next, we count how many of these points fall inside the quarter circle (points that satisfy the conditionx^2 + y^2 \\leq 1)\nEstimate π:Finally, we estimate the value ofπusing the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points, scaled by 4 because we're simulating within a quarter circle of a unit square.\nOutput:"

    "output": "In finance,Value at Risk (VaR)is a risk management tool used to estimate the potential loss in the value of an asset or portfolio over a specified time period, given a certain confidence level. It can be a useful in estimating VaR by simulating the future value of an asset or portfolio under different scenarios.\nHere we will do:\nOutput:\nThe estimated VaR of -4.00% means there is a 95% probability that the portfolio will lose no more than 4% of its value over the specified period. A 5% chance exists that the loss could exceed 4%. This helps assess financial risk and supports informed decision-making."
