  {
    "input": "1. Beta Distribution",
    "output": "TheBeta distributionmodels probabilities for two possible outcomes such as success or failure. It is defined by two parameters α and β that shape the distribution. Theprobability density function (PDF)is given by:\nWhere B(α, β) is the beta function."
  },
  {
    "input": "2. Dirichlet Distribution",
    "output": "TheDirichlet distributionis a generalization of the Beta distribution for multiple outcomes. It represents the probabilities of different categories like rolling a dice with unknown probabilities for each side. The PDF of the Dirichlet distribution is:\np=(p1​,p2​,…, pK​) is a vector representing a probability distribution over K categories. Each pi​ is a probability and ∑K​pi​=1.\nα=(α1​,α2​,…,αK​) is a vector of positive shape parameters. This determines the shape of the distribution\nB(α) is a beta function."

  {
    "input": "How α Affects the Distribution",
    "output": "Higher α values result in probabilities concentrated around the mean.\nEqual α values produce symmetric distributions.\nDifferent α values create skewed distributions."

  {
    "input": "Dirichlet Process (DP)",
    "output": "ADirichlet Processis a stochastic process that generates probability distributions over infinite categories. It enables clustering without specifying the number of clusters in advance. The Dirichlet Process is defined as:\nWhere:\nα:Concentration parameter controlling cluster diversity.\nG₀:Base distribution representing the prior belief about cluster parameters."

  {
    "input": "Stick-Breaking Process",
    "output": "Thestick-breaking processis a method to generate probabilities from a Dirichlet Process. The concept is shown in the image below:\nWe take a stick of length unit 1 representing our base probability distribution\nUsing marginal distribution property we break it into two. We use beta distribution. Suppose the length obtained is p1\nThe conditional probability of the remaining categories is a Dirichlet distribution\nThe length of the stick that remains is 1-p1 and using the marginal property again\nRepeat the above steps to obtain enough pi such that the sum is close to 1\nMathematically this can be expressed asFor k=1,p1=β(1,α)For k=2,p2=β(1,α)∗(1−p1)For k=3,p3=β(1,α)∗(1−p1−p2)\nFor k=1,p1=β(1,α)\nFor k=2,p2=β(1,α)∗(1−p1)\nFor k=3,p3=β(1,α)∗(1−p1−p2)\nFor each categories sample we also sample μ from our base distribution. This becomes our cluster parameters."

It uses the Dirichlet Process as a prior for the mixture components.\nThe probability of assigning a point to an existing cluster is:\\frac{n_k}{n-1+\\alpha} \\Nu (\\mu,1)\nThe probability of assigning a point to a new cluster is:\\frac{\\alpha}{n-1+\\alpha}\\Nu(0,1)\nWhere:\nnₖ:Number of points in cluster k.\nα:Concentration parameter.\nN(μ, σ):Gaussian distribution.\nDPMM is an extension of Gaussian Mixture Models where the number of clusters is not fixed.

    "output": "Clusters are visualized with different colors making patterns easier to interpret.\nOutput:\nThe clustering of mall customers using DPMM highlights distinct groups where average customers in the center and extreme spenders on the edges. Overlapping clusters suggest some customers share similar behaviors."
  },
  {
    "input": "Advantages over Traditional Methods",
    "output": "One of the primary advantage of DPMMs is their ability to automatically determine the number of clusters in the data. Traditional methods often require the pre-specification of the number of clusters like in k-means which can be challenging in real-world applications.\nIt operate within a probabilistic framework allowing for the quantification of uncertainty. Traditional methods often provide \"hard\" assignments of data points to clusters while DPMMs give probabilistic cluster assignments capturing the uncertainty inherent in the data.\nDPMMs find applications in a wide range of fields including natural language processing, computer vision, bioinformatics and finance. Their flexibility makes them applicable to diverse datasets and problem domains."
