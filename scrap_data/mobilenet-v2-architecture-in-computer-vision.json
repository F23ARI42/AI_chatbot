    "input": "2. Depthwise Separable Convolutions",
    "output": "Similar to MobileNet V1, MobileNet V2 utilizes depthwise separable convolutions, which split a standard convolution into two operations: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. This separation significantly reduces the number of parameters and computations, making the network more efficient."

    "input": "3. Linear Bottlenecks",
    "output": "The architecture incorporates linear bottlenecks between layers, ensuring that the manifold of the input data is not overly compressed. This technique helps in retaining more information and improving model accuracy. The linear bottleneck layer follows the pattern of 1x1 convolution for expansion, depthwise convolution for spatial filtering, and another 1x1 convolution for projection."
