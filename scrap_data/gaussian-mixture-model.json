    "output": "To fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the data we use theExpectation-Maximization (EM)algorithm which is an iterative method that optimize the parameters of the Gaussian distributions like mean, covariance and mixing coefficients. It works in two main steps:\nExpectation Step (E-step):In this step the algorithm calculates the probability that each data point belongs to each cluster based on the current parameter estimates (mean, covariance, mixing coefficients).\nMaximization Step (M-step):After estimating the probabilities the algorithm updates the parameters (mean, covariance and mixing coefficients) to better fit the data.\nThese two steps are repeated until the model converges meaning the parameters no longer change significantly between iterations. Here’s a simple breakdown of the  GMM process:\nFormula:\nThe E-step computes the probabilities that each data point belongs to each Gaussian while the M-step updates the parameters μk​, Σk ​ and πk based on these probabilities."

    "output": "In a Gaussian Mixture Model, each cluster is modeled by a Gaussian distribution characterized by:\nMean (μ):The mean represents the central point or average location of the cluster in the feature space. It defines where the cluster is centered.\nCovariance (Σ):The covariance matrix describes the shape, size and orientation of the cluster. Unlike simpler clustering methods such as K-Means which assume spherical (circular) clusters, the covariance allows Gaussian components to take on elliptical shapes. This means clusters can be stretched, compressed or tilted depending on the relationships between features.\nTo visualize these concepts, consider two sets of data points generated from two Gaussians with different means and covariances:\nScatter plots show the raw data points clustered around their respective means.\nOverlaidkernel density estimate(KDE) contours represent the smooth shape of each Gaussian, illustrating the cluster’s distribution and spread.\nThis visualization highlights the flexibility of GMMs to model clusters that are not necessarily spherical and can overlap, making them more powerful than simpler methods like K-Means that assume equally sized, spherical clusters. By adjusting the mean and covariance, GMM adapts to the true underlying data distribution more accurately."
