    "input": "What is Data Mining?",
    "output": "Data mining is the process of extracting insights from large datasets using statistical and computational techniques. It can involve structured, semi-structured or unstructured data stored in databases, data warehouses or data lakes. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and relationships to support informed decision-making and predictions using methods like clustering, classification, regression and anomaly detection.\nData mining is widely used in industries such as marketing, finance, healthcare and telecommunications. For example, it helps identify customer segments in marketing or detect disease risk factors in healthcare. However, it also raises ethical concerns particularly regarding privacy and the misuse of personal data, requiring careful safeguards."
