    "output": "Hyperplane: The decision boundary separating classes. It is a line in 2D, a plane in 3D or a hyperplane in higher dimensions.\nSupport Vectors: The data points closest to the hyperplane. These points directly influence its position and orientation.\nMargin: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors from each class. SVMs aim to maximize this margin for better robustness and generalization.\nRegularization Parameter (C): Controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors. A high value of C prioritizes correct classification but may overfit. A low value of C prioritizes a larger margin but may underfit."

By maximizing the margin around the decision boundary, they deliver strong generalization performance across diverse datasets."
