    "input": "Supervised Learning",
    "output": "Involves training models using labeled datasets. Both input and output variables are provided during training.\nThe aim is to establish a mapping function that predicts outcomes for new, unseen data.\nCommon applications include classification, regression, and forecasting."
  },
  {
    "input": "Unsupervised Learning",
    "output": "Works with unlabeled data where outputs are not known in advance.\nThe model identifies hidden structures, relationships, or groupings in the data.\nUseful for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\nFocuses on discovering inherent patterns within datasets."
  },
  {
    "input": "Reinforcement Learning",
    "output": "Based on decision-making through interaction with an environment.\nAn agent performs actions and receives rewards or penalties as feedback.\nThe goal is to learn an optimal strategy that maximizes long-term rewards.\nWidely applied in robotics, autonomous systems, and strategic game playing."

    "input": "Real-World Application of Machine Learning",
    "output": "Here are some specific areas where machine learning is being used:\nPredictive modelling:Machine learning can be used to build predictive models that can help businesses make better decisions. For example, machine learning can be used to predict which customers are most likely to buy a particular product, or which patients are most likely to develop a certain disease.\nNatural language processing:Machine learning is used to build systems that can understand and interpret human language. This is important for applications such as voice recognition, chatbots, and language translation.\nComputer vision:Machine learning is used to build systems that can recognize and interpret images and videos. This is important for applications such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, and medical imaging.\nFraud detection:Machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent behavior in financial transactions, online advertising, and other areas.\nRecommendation systems:Machine learning can be used to build recommendation systems that suggest products, services, or content to users based on their past behaviour and preferences.\nOverall, machine learning has become an essential tool for many businesses and industries, as it enables them to make better use of data, improve their decision-making processes, and deliver more personalized experiences to their customers."
