    "input": "Interpretation of Mean Squared Error",
    "output": "The Interpreting MSE involves understanding the magnitude of the error and its implications for the model's performance.\nA lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, signifying better accuracy.\nConversely, a higher MSE suggests that the model's predictions deviate further from the true value, indicating poorer performance."

  {
    "input": "Root Mean Square Error",
    "output": "The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a variant of MSE that calculates the square root of the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. It is often preferred over MSE as it provides an interpretable measure of the error in the same units as the original data."

  {
    "input": "MSE vs RMSE",
    "output": "Mean Squared Error is often compared with other error metrics, such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), to evaluate model performance.\nWhile MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, RMSE measures the square root of the average squared difference. The MSE and RMSE penalize large errors more heavily than MAE, making them more sensitive to the outliers."
