  },
  {
    "input": "1. Recurrent Neurons",
    "output": "The fundamental processing unit in RNN is aRecurrent Unit.They hold a hidden state that maintains information about previous inputs in a sequence. Recurrent units can \"remember\" information from prior steps by feeding back their hidden state, allowing them to capture dependencies across time."
  },
  {
    "input": "2. RNN Unfolding",
    "output": "RNN unfolding or unrolling is the process of expanding the recurrent structure over time steps. During unfolding each step of the sequence is represented as a separate layer in a series illustrating how information flows across each time step.\nThis unrolling enablesbackpropagation through time (BPTT)a learning process where errors are propagated across time steps to adjust the network’s weights enhancing the RNN’s ability to learn dependencies within sequential data."

  {
    "input": "Recurrent Neural Network Architecture",
    "output": "RNNs share similarities in input and output structures with other deep learning architectures but differ significantly in how information flows from input to output. Unlike traditional deep neural networks where each dense layer has distinct weight matrices. RNNs use shared weights across time steps, allowing them to remember information over sequences.\nIn RNNs the hidden stateH_i​ is calculated for every inputX_i​ to retain sequential dependencies. The computations follow these core formulas:\n1. Hidden State Calculation:\nHere:\nhrepresents the current hidden state.\nUandWare weight matrices.\nBis the bias.\n2. Output Calculation:\nThe outputYis calculated by applyingOan activation function to the weighted hidden state whereVandCrepresent weights and bias.\n3.

  {
    "input": "How does RNN work?",
    "output": "At each time step RNNs process units with a fixed activation function. These units have an internal hidden state that acts as memory that retains information from previous time steps. This memory allows the network to store past knowledge and adapt based on new inputs."
  },
  {
    "input": "Updating the Hidden State in RNNs",
    "output": "The current hidden stateh_t​ depends on the previous stateh_{t-1}​ and the current inputx_t​ and is calculated using the following relations:\n1. State Update:\nwhere:\nh_t​ is the current state\nh_{t-1}​ is the previous state\nx_tis the input at the current time step\n2. Activation Function Application:\nh_t = \\tanh(W_{hh} \\cdot h_{t-1} + W_{xh} \\cdot x_t)\nHere,W_{hh}​ is the weight matrix for the recurrent neuron andW_{xh}​ is the weight matrix for the input neuron.\n3. Output Calculation:\nwherey_t​ is the output andW_{hy}​ is the weight at the output layer.\nThese parameters are updated using backpropagation. However, since RNN works on sequential data here we use an updated backpropagation which is known asbackpropagation through time."

  {
    "input": "Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in RNNs",
    "output": "Since RNNs process sequential dataBackpropagation Through Time (BPTT)is used to update the network's parameters. The loss function L(θ) depends on the final hidden stateh_3and each hidden state relies on preceding ones forming a sequential dependency chain:\nh_3depends on\\text{ depends on } h_2, \\, h_2 \\text{ depends on } h_1, \\, \\dots, \\, h_1 \\text{ depends on } h_0​.\nIn BPTT, gradients are backpropagated through each time step. This is essential for updating network parameters based on temporal dependencies.\n1. Simplified Gradient Calculation:\n2. Handling Dependencies in Layers:Each hidden state is updated based on its dependencies:\nThe gradient is then calculated for each state, considering dependencies from previous hidden states.\n3. Gradient Calculation with Explicit and Implicit Parts:The gradient is broken down into explicit and implicit parts summing up the indirect paths from each hidden state to the weights.\n4. Final Gradient Expression:The final derivative of the loss function with respect to the weight matrix W is computed:\nThis iterative process is the essence of backpropagation through time."

This makes them suitable for tasks with independent inputs like image classification. However FNNs struggle with sequential data since they lack memory.\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) solve thisby incorporating loops that allow information from previous steps to be fed back into the network. This feedback enables RNNs to remember prior inputs making them ideal for tasks where context is important."
