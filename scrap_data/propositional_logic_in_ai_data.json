    "output": "Propositional logicworks with statements called propositions that can be true or false. These propositions represent facts or conditions about a situation. We use symbols to represent the propositions and logical operations to connect those propositions. It help us understand how different facts are related to each other in complex statements or problem. Proposition operators like conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), negation (¬), implication( →) and biconditional (↔) helps combine various proposition to represent logical relations."

For example:\nP ∧ Q: \"The sky is blue AND it is raining.\" (This is true only if both P and Q are true.)\nP ∨ Q: \"The sky is blue OR it is raining.\" (This is true if at least one of P or Q is true.)\n¬P: \"It is NOT true that the sky is blue.\" (This is true if P is false means the sky is not blue.)"

    "output": "Two statements are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth values in every possible situation. For example:\nThe statement \"S → T\" (if S then T) is equivalent to \"¬S ∨ T\" (not S or T). This means \"if S is true, then T must be true\" is the same as \"either S is false or T is true.\"\nThe biconditional \"P ↔ Q\" (P if and only if Q) is equivalent to \"(P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)\" (P implies Q and Q implies P).\nThese equivalences show that different logical expressions can have the same meaning. You can verify them using truth tables or by simplifying the statements with logical rules."

    "output": "A proposition is a statement that can either be true or false. It does not matter how complicated statement is if it can be classified as true or false then it is a proposition. For example:\n\"The sky is blue.\" (True)\n\"It is raining.\" (False)"

    "output": "Logical connectives are used to combine simple propositions into more complex ones.

    "output": "They are used to find the truth value of complex propositions by checking all possible combinations of truth values for their components. They systematically list every possible combinations which helps in making it easy to find how different logical operators affect the overall outcome. This approach ensures that no combination is given extra importance which provides a clear and complete picture of the logic at work."

Double Negation:Negating a proposition twice cancels out the negation.\n¬ (¬P) ≡ P\n7.Idempotence: Repeating same proposition with AND or OR doesn’t change its value.\nP ∧ P ≡ P\nP ∨ P ≡ P"

    "input": "Applications of Propositional Logic in AI",
    "output": "1. Knowledge Representation:Propositional logic is used to represent knowledge in a structured way. It allows AI systems to store and manipulate facts about the world. For example in expert systems knowledge is encoded as a set of propositions and logical rules.\n2. Automated Reasoning:AI uses logical rules such as Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens which help systems to find new conclusions from existing fact and to \"think\" logically. For example:\nModus Ponens:If \"P → Q\" and \"P\" are true then \"Q\" must be true.\nModus Tollens:If \"P → Q\" and \"¬Q\" are true then \"¬P\" must be true.\n3. Problem Solving and Planning:It allows AI planners to solve problems and to create action sequences by representing goals. For example theSTRIPS planning systemhelps propositional logic to represent preconditions and effects of actions.\n4. Decision Making:It helps to evaluate various options and find the best course of action. Logical rules can encode decision criteria and truth tables can be used to assess the outcomes of different choices.\n5. Natural Language Processing (NLP):It is applied in NLP for tasks like semantic parsing where natural language sentences are converted into logical representations. This helps in understanding and reasoning about the meaning of sentences."
