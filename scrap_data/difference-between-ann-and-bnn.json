    "input": "1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)",
    "output": "Artificial Neural Networksare computational models inspired by the human brain's neural architecture. The simplest form of ANN follows afeed-forward mechanismwhere data flows from input to output without looping back. These networks consist of interconnected layers: input layers that receive data, hidden layers that process it and output layers that produce the final result.\nAdvantages of ANNs:\nVersatile Learning:ANNs can handle both linear and non-linear data which makes them applicable across diverse domains.\nForecasting:They are sensitive to complex patterns making them effective intime series forecastingsuch as predicting stock prices or economic trends.\nDisadvantages of ANNs:\nLack of Interpretability:Due to their black-box nature, it is difficult to understand how decisions are made within the network.\nHardware Dependence:ANNs require heavy computational resources which can limit their scalability in certain environments."

    "input": "2. Biological Neural Networks (BNNs)",
    "output": "Biological Neural Networks are the foundation of cognition in living organisms. A biological neuron comprises dendrites, a cell body and an axon. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons, the soma integrates these inputs and the axon transmits the resulting signal to subsequent neurons via synapses.\nAdvantages of BNNs:\nInput Handling:Biological synapses are capable of interpreting and integrating a wide variety of stimuli/inputs.\nParallel Processing:BNNs are efficient at processing massive amounts of information simultaneously, enabling rapid responses.\nDisadvantages of BNNs:\nLack of Central Control:Unlike artificial systems, BNNs lack a clear central processing unit, which can make control mechanisms less structured.\nSlower Processing:BNNs operate at slower speeds compared to silicon-based systems due to the nature of electrochemical transmission."

    "input": "Key Differences Between ANNs and BNNs",
    "output": "BNNs:Composed of biological structures like dendrites and axons, with complex behavior and signal processing abilities.\nANNs:Use simplified models of neurons with a single output, focusing on numerical signal transformations through activation functions.\nBNNs:Adapts based on learning, experience and environmental factors.\nANNs:Use fixed mathematical weights that are adjusted during training but remain static during testing.\nBNNs:Feature a highly complex web of adaptable pathways influenced by learning and memory.\nANNs:Have predefined pathways determined by network architecture and model design.\nBiological Neural Networks are flexible and capable of real-time learning. In contrast, Artificial Neural Networks are simplified, task-specific systems that prioritize speed and precision. The aim of ongoing research is to draw insights from brain to make artificial systems more adaptive and intelligent."
