    "input": "1. Neural Network",
    "output": "The network approximates the Q-value functionQ(s,a;θ)where\\thetarepresents the trainable parameters.\nFor example in Atari games the input might be raw pixels from the game screen and the output is a vector of Q-values corresponding to each possible action."

    "input": "2. Experience Replay",
    "output": "To stabilize training, DQNs store past experiences(s,a,r,s′)in a replay buffer.\nDuring training, mini-batches of experiences are sampled randomly from the buffer, breaking the correlation between consecutive experiences and improving generalization."

    "input": "Training Process of Deep Q-Learning",
    "output": "The training process of a DQN involves the following steps:\n1. Initialization:\nInitialize the replay buffer, main network (\\theta) and target network (\\theta^{-}).\nSet hyperparameters such as learning rate (\\alpha), discount factor (\\gamma) and exploration rate (\\epsilon).\n2. Exploration vs. Exploitation: Use an\\epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation:\nWith probability\\epsilon, select a random action to explore.\nOtherwise, choose the action with the highest Q-value according to the current network.\n3. Experience Collection: Interact with the environment, collect experiences(s,a,r,s′)and store them in the replay buffer.\n4. Training Updates:\nSample a mini-batch of experiences from the replay buffer.\nCompute the target Q-values using the target network.\nUpdate the main network by minimizing the loss function using gradient descent.\n5. Target Network Update: Periodically copy the weights of the main network to the target network to ensure stability.\n6. Decay Exploration Rate: Gradually decrease\\epsilonover time to shift from exploration to exploitation."
