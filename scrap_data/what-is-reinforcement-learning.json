Policy\nDefines the agent’s behavior i.e maps states for actions.\nCan be simple rules or complex computations.\nExample: An autonomous car maps pedestrian detection to make necessary stops.\n2. Reward Signal\nRepresents the goal of the RL problem.\nGuides the agent by providing feedback (positive/negative rewards).\nExample: For self-driving cars rewards can be fewer collisions, shorter travel time, lane discipline.\n3. Value Function\nEvaluates long-term benefits, not just immediate rewards.\nMeasures desirability of a state considering future outcomes.\nExample: A vehicle may avoid reckless maneuvers (short-term gain) to maximize overall safety and efficiency.\n4. Model\nSimulates the environment to predict outcomes of actions.\nEnables planning and foresight.\nExample: Predicting other vehicles’ movements to plan safer routes."

    "input": "Working of Reinforcement Learning",
    "output": "The agent interacts iteratively with its environment in a feedback loop:\nThe agent observes the current state of the environment.\nIt chooses and performs an action based on its policy.\nThe environment responds by transitioning to a new state and providing a reward (or penalty).\nThe agent updates its knowledge (policy, value function) based on the reward received and the new state.\nThis cycle repeats with the agent balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) to maximize the cumulative reward over time.\nThis process is mathematically framed as aMarkov Decision Process (MDP)where future states depend only on the current state and action, not on the prior sequence of events."

In other words, it has a positive effect on behavior.\nAdvantages: Maximizes performance, helps sustain change over time.\nDisadvantages: Overuse can lead to excess states that may reduce effectiveness.\n2. Negative Reinforcement: Negative Reinforcement is defined as strengthening of behavior because a negative condition is stopped or avoided.\nAdvantages: Increases behavior frequency, ensures a minimum performance standard.\nDisadvantages: It may only encourage just enough action to avoid penalties."

    "input": "Online vs. Offline Learning",
    "output": "Reinforcement Learning can be categorized based on how and when the learning agent acquires data from its environment, dividing the methods into online RL and offline RL (also known as batch RL).\nIn online RL, the agent learns by actively interacting with the environment in real-time. It collects fresh data during training by executing actions and observing immediate feedback as it learns.\nOffline RL trains the agent exclusively on a pre-collected static dataset of interactions generated by other agents, human demonstrations or historical logs. The agent does not interact with the environment during learning."
