    "output": "Fuzzy clustering follows an iterative optimization process where data points are assigned membership values instead of hard cluster labels. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\nStep 1: Initialize Membership Values Randomly:Each data point is assigned initial membership degrees for all clusters. These values represent the likelihood of the point belonging to each cluster. Unlike hard clustering, a point can partially belong to multiple clusters simultaneously.\nFor example, for 2 clusters and 4 data points, an initial membership matrix (\\gamma) might look like:\nStep 2: Compute Cluster Centroids:Cluster centroids are calculated as the weighted average of all data points, where weights are the membership values raised to the fuzziness parameter m. Points with higher membership influence centroids more.\nThe centroid coordinatev_{ij}for clusteriand featurejis:\nWhere:\n\\gamma_{ik}​ = membership of point k in clusteri.\nm= fuzziness parameter (usually 2).\nx_{kj}​ = value of feature j for pointk.\nStep 3: Calculate Distance Between Data Points and Centroids:Compute the Euclidean distance between each point and every centroid to determine proximity, which will be used to update memberships. Example for point (1,3):\nSimilarly the distance of all other points is computed from both the centroids.\nStep 4: Update Membership Values:Membership values are updated inversely proportional to these distances. Points closer to a centroid get higher membership.\nUpdated membership\\gamma_{ik}for point k in clusteriis:\nStep 5: Repeat Until Convergence:Steps 2–4 are repeated until the membership values stabilize meaning there are no significant changes from one iteration to the next. This indicates that the clustering has reached an optimal state."
