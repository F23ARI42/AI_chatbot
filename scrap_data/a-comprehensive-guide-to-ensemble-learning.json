    "output": "Bagging classifiercan be used for both regression and classification tasks. Here is an overview of Bagging classifier algorithm:\nBootstrap Sampling:Divides the original training data into ‘N’ subsets and randomly selects a subset with replacement in some rows from other subsets. This step ensures that the base models are trained on diverse subsets of the data and there is no class imbalance.\nBase Model Training:For each bootstrapped sample we train a base model independently on that subset of data. These weak models are trained in parallel to increase computational efficiency and reduce time consumption. We can use different base learners i.e. different ML models as base learners to bring variety and robustness.\nPrediction Aggregation:To make a prediction on testing data combine the predictions of all base models. For classification tasks it can include majority voting or weighted majority while for regression it involves averaging the predictions.\nOut-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation: Some samples are excluded from the training subset of particular base models during the bootstrapping method. These “out-of-bag” samples can be used to estimate the model’s performance without the need for cross-validation.\nFinal Prediction:After aggregating the predictions from all the base models, Bagging produces a final prediction for each instance."

    "output": "Boostingis an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. Weak models are trained in series such that each next model tries to correct errors of the previous model until the entire training dataset is predicted correctly. One of the most well-known boosting algorithms isAdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting).Here is an overview of Boosting algorithm:\nInitialize Model Weights: Begin with a single weak learner and assign equal weights to all training examples.\nTrain Weak Learner: Train weak learners on these dataset.\nSequential Learning: Boosting works by training models sequentially where each model focuses on correcting the errors of its predecessor. Boosting typically uses a single type of weak learner like decision trees.\nWeight Adjustment: Boosting assigns weights to training datapoints. Misclassified examples receive higher weights in the next iteration so that next models pay more attention to them."
