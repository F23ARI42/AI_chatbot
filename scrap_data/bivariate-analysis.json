    "output": "The type of bivariate analysis used depends on thenature of the variablesinvolved — whether they arenumerical,categorical, orordinal. The choice of statistical technique is guided by how these variables interact.\n1)Numerical Vs Numerical:\nIn this type, both the independent and dependent variables are numerical.\nHeight vs. Weight– Do taller people tend to weigh more?\nStudy Hours vs. Test Scores– Is there a relationship between time spent studying and performance?\n2)Categorical vs Categorical:\nHere,both variables are categorical. The goal is often to test for association or independence.\nGender vs. Product Preference– Do preferences vary between male and female customers?\n3)Numerical vs Categorical:\nIn this scenario,one variable is numerical(usually the dependent), and theother is categorical(often the independent).\nEducation Level vs. Income– How does education level impact salary?"

    "output": "Scatter Plotsvisually display the relationship between two variables. Each dot on the plot represents a single observation, (xi, yi). The pattern formed by the dots can reveal the nature of the relationship between the variables—whether it's positive, negative, or no correlation.\nPositive Trend:Points slope upward (e.g., height vs. weight).\nNegative Trend:Points slope downward (e.g., TV time vs. grades).\nNo Pattern:Random cloud (e.g., shoe size vs. IQ)."

    "input": "Correlation Analysis",
    "output": "Correlation Analysisquantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between two continuous variables.\nThe correlation coefficient, typically denoted by \"r,\" ranges from -1 to 1.\nA positive value indicates a positive correlation (as one variable increases, the other tends to increase), while a negative value suggests a negative correlation (as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease).\nA value close to zero indicates little to no correlation."

  {
    "input": "Regression Analysis",
    "output": "Regression analysisexplores the relationship between two or more variables by predicting one variable (the dependent variable) based on the values of one or more other variables (the independent variables).\nSimple linear regression involves predicting a dependent variable from a single independent variable, while multiple linear regression involves predicting the dependent variable from multiple independent variables."

    "input": "Chi-Square Test",
    "output": "Thechi-square testexamines the association between two categorical variables by comparing the observed frequencies in a contingency table to the frequencies that would be expected if the variables were independent.\nIt determines whether the observed association between the variables is statistically significant or due to random chance."

    "input": "T-tests and ANOVA",
    "output": "T-testsand analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to compare means between groups for one or more independent variables. In bivariate analysis, they can be applied to examine whether there are significant differences in the mean values of a continuous variable across different categories of another variable.\nT-tests are suitable for comparing means between two groups, while ANOVA is used for comparing means among three or more groups."
