    "output": "Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)is a popular manifold learning algorithm used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. It assumes that each data point and its neighbors lie on or close to a locally linear patch of the manifold, and aims to reconstruct the data's manifold structure by preserving these local relationships in lower-dimensional space. It works by:\nConstructing a neighborhood graph:Each data point is connected to its nearest neighbors, capturing the local geometric structure.\nFinding the weights for local linear reconstructions:It calculates the weights that best represent each data point as a linear combination of its neighbors.\nEmbedding the data in a lower-dimensional space: It minimizes the reconstruction error by finding the lower-dimensional coordinates (2D or 1D) that preserve the local structure.\nLLE can be sensitive to the number of neighbors chosen and may not preserve the global shape of the dataset."

The numbers in the plot titles show the reconstruction error, lower error means the method kept the structure better."
