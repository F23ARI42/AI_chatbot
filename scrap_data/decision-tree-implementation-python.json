Each node in the tree represents a decision, and each branch represents an outcome of that decision. The leaves of the tree represent the final decisions or predictions.\nDecision trees are created by recursively partitioning the data into smaller and smaller subsets. At each partition, the data is split based on a specific feature, and the split is made in a way that maximizes the information gain.\nIn the above figure, decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure that is used to make decisions. It consists of Root Node(WINDY), Internal nodes(OUTLOOK, TEMPERATURE), which represent tests on attributes, and leaf nodes, which represent the final decisions. The branches of the tree represent the possible outcomes of the tests."

The higher the entropy the more the information content.\nDefinition: Suppose S is a set of instances, A is an attribute,S_{v}is the subset of s with A = v and Values(A) is the set of all possible of A, then\nThe entropy typically changes when we use a node in a Python decision tree to partition the training instances into smaller subsets. Information gain is a measure of this change in entropy.\nSklearn supports “entropy” criteria for Information Gain and if we want to use Information Gain method in sklearn then we have to mention it explicitly."

You can install it using\nWhile implementing the decision tree in Python we will go through the following two phases:\nTo import and manipulate the data we are using thepandaspackage provided in python.\nHere, we are using a URL which is directly fetching the dataset from the UCI site no need to download the dataset. When you try to run this code on your system make sure the system should have an active Internet connection.\nAs the dataset is separated by \",\" so we have to pass the sep parameter's value as \",\".\nAnother thing is notice is that the dataset doesn't contain the header so we will pass the Header parameter's value as none. If we will not pass the header parameter then it will consider the first line of the dataset as the header.\nBefore training the model we have to split the dataset into the training and testing dataset.\nTo split the dataset for training and testing we are using the sklearn moduletrain_test_split\nFirst of all we have to separate the target variable from the attributes in the dataset.\nAbove are the lines from the code which separate the dataset. The variable X contains the attributes while the variable Y contains the target variable of the dataset.\nNext step is to split the dataset for training and testing purpose.\nAbove line split the dataset for training and testing.
