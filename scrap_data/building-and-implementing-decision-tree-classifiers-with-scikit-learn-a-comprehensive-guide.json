    "output": "Hyperparameters are configuration settings that control the behavior of a decision tree model and significantly affect its performance. Proper tuning can improve accuracy, reduce overfitting and enhance generalization of model. Popular methods for tuning include Grid Search, Random Search and Bayesian Optimization which explore different combinations to find the best configuration.\nLet's make use of Scikit-Learn's GridSearchCVto find the best combination of of hyperparameter values. The code is as follows:\nOutput:\nHere we defined the parameter grid with a set of hyperparameters and a list of possible values. The GridSearchCV evaluates the different hyperparameter combinations for the Decision Tree Classifier and selects the best combination of hyperparameters based on the performance across all k folds."

We'll plot feature importance obtained from the Decision Tree model to see which features have the greatest predictive power. Here we fetch the best estimator obtained from the GridSearchCV as the decision tree classifier.\nOutput:\nWe can see that it start from the root node (depth 0 at the top).\nThe root node checks whether the flower petal width is less than or equal to 0.75. If it is then we move to the root's left child node (depth1, left). Here the left node doesn't have any child nodes so the classifier will predict the class for that node assetosa.\nIf the petal width is greater than 0.75 then we must move down to the root's right child node (depth 1, right). Here the right node is not a leaf node, so node check for the condition until it reaches the leaf node.\nBy using hyperparameter tuning methods like GridSearchCV we can optimize their performance."
