    "output": "Now that we know data processing and its key steps we will now understand how it works in real world.\n\nCollection: High-quality data collection is essential for training machine learning models. This data can be collected from trusted sources like Kaggle or UCI repositories. Using accurate and relevant data ensures the model learns effectively and produces high-quality results.\nPreparation: Raw data cannot be directly used in models. Thus it needs to be prepared through data cleaning, feature extraction and conversion. For example an image might be converted into a matrix of pixel values which makes model processing easier.\nInput: Prepared data sometimes needs to be converted into a form that is readable by machines. This requires algorithms capable of transforming and structuring data accurately for efficient processing.\nProcessing: This is where machine learning algorithms come in. This step transforms the data into meaningful information using techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning or deep learning.\nOutput: After processing the model generates results in a meaningful format such as reports, graphs or predictions which can be easily interpreted and used by stakeholders.\nStorage: Finally all data and results are stored securely in databases or cloud storage for future use and reference."

    "input": "Disadvantages of Data Processing in Machine Learning",
    "output": "Time-Consuming: Data processing can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially for large datasets.\nError-Prone: Manual data processing or poorly configured tools can introduce errors, such as losing important information or creating biases.\nLimited Data Understanding: Processing data may sometimes result in a loss of insight into the original data, which can affect the model’s understanding of the underlying relationships.\nData processing is an essential part of the machine learning pipeline ensuring that raw data is transformed into a form that machine learning models can understand. While it can be time-consuming and error-prone its benefits in improving model performance, accuracy and reliability makes it best for creating effective machine learning models."
