    "input": "1. Policy Update Rule",
    "output": "PPO updates the agent’s policy using policy gradients adjusting it in the direction that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.\nUnlike standard policy gradient methods, it ensures updates are controlled and stable."
  },
  {
    "input": "2. Surrogate Objective",
    "output": "Instead of directly maximizing rewards, PPO maximizes a surrogate objective that measures improvement over the old policy:\nThis allows the algorithm to evaluate the benefit of new actions while referencing the old policy."
  },

    "input": "3. Clipping Mechanism",
    "output": "Introduces a clip function to limit the probability ratio between new and old policies:\nPrevents excessively large policy updates that could destabilize learning."

  {
    "input": "4. Advantage Estimation",
    "output": "Computes the advantageA_tto determine how much better or worse an action was compared to the expected value of the state.\nGuides the policy update by increasing the probability of better actions and decreasing that of worse actions."

Select log probs of generated tokens:Picking only the log probabilities for the generated words.\n4. Compute reward:\nBase reward = text length / 25 (max 1).\nBonus +0.5 if text contains “good” or “great”.\n5.
