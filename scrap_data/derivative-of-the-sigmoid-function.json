    "output": "If we use a linear activation function in aneural network, the model will only be able to separate data linearly, which results in poor performance on non-linear datasets. However, by adding a hidden layer with a sigmoid activation function, the model gains the ability to handle non-linearity, thereby improving performance.\nDuring thebackpropagation, the model calculates and updates weights and biases by computing the derivative of the activation function. The sigmoid function is useful because:\nIt is the only function that appears in its derivative.\nIt is differentiable at every point, which helps in the effective computation of gradients during backpropagation."

    "input": "Issue with Sigmoid Function in Backpropagation",
    "output": "One key issue with using the sigmoid function is the vanishing gradient problem. When updating weights and biases using gradient descent, if the gradients are too small, the updates to weights and biases become insignificant, slowing down or even stopping learning.\nThe shades red region highlights the areas where the derivative\\sigma^{'}(x)is very small (close to 0). In these regions, the gradients used to update weights and biases during backpropagation become extremely small. As a result, the model learns very slowly or stops learning altogether, which is a major issue in deep neural networks."
