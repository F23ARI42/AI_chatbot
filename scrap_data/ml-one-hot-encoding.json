    "input": "How One-Hot Encoding Works: An Example",
    "output": "To grasp the concept better let's explore a simple example. Imagine we have a dataset with fruits their categorical values and corresponding prices. Using one-hot encoding we can transform these categorical values into numerical form. For example:\nWherever the fruit is \"Apple,\" the Apple column will have a value of 1 while the other fruit columns (like Mango or Orange) will contain 0.\nThis pattern ensures that each categorical value gets its own column represented with binary values (1 or 0) making it usable for machine learning models.\nThe output after applying one-hot encoding on the data is given as follows,"

  {
    "input": "1. Using Pandas",
    "output": "Pandas offers theget_dummiesfunctionwhich is a simple and effective way to perform one-hot encoding. This methodconverts categorical variables into multiple binary columns.\nFor example theGendercolumn with values'M'and'F'becomes two binary columns:Gender_FandGender_M.\ndrop_first=True in pandasdrops one redundant column e.g., keeps onlyGender_Fto avoid multicollinearity.\nOutput:\nWe can observe that we have3 Remarksand2 Gendercolumns in the data.However you can just usen-1columns to define parameters if it hasnunique labels.For example if we only keep theGender_Femalecolumn and drop theGender_Malecolumn then also we can convey the entire information as when the label is 1 it means female and when the label is 0 it means male. This way we can encode the categorical data and reduce the number of parameters as well."

    "output": "Scikit-learn(sklearn) is a popular machine-learning library in Python that provide numerous tools for data preprocessing. It provides aOneHotEncoderfunction that we use for encoding categorical and numerical variables into binary vectors. Usingdf.select_dtypes(include=['object'])in Scikit Learn Library:\nThis selectsonly the columns with categorical data(data typeobject).\nIn this case,['Gender', 'Remarks']are identified as categorical columns.\nOutput:\nBothPandasandScikit-Learnoffer robust solutions for one-hot encoding.\nUsePandasget_dummies()when you need quick and simple encoding.\nUseScikit-LearnOneHotEncoderwhen working within a machine learning pipeline or when you need finer control over encoding behavior."
