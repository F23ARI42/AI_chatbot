So finding the middle term is quite simple.\nBut when we are given with even number of data (say 4 data sets), 1, 2, 3, and 4, then finding the median is quite tricky as by observing we can see that there is no single middle term then for finding the median we use a different concept.\nHere, we will learn about the median of grouped and ungrouped data in detail."

Thus, the median of the two numbers a and b is,\nMedian = (a + b)/2\nNow let's understand this using an example, find the median of the following 23 and 27\nSolution:\nRead More,\nStatistics\nMeasure of central tendency\nMean, Median, and Mode"

    "output": "The median is an important statistical measure that helps us find the middle value of a dataset. It is especially useful when the data contains extreme values, as it provides a better representation of the central tendency compared to the mean. Calculating the median is simple and offers an easy way to understand the distribution of values in a set."
