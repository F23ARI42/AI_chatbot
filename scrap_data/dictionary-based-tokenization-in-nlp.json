    "input": "How Does Dictionary-Based Tokenization Work?",
    "output": "In dictionary-based tokenization, the process of splitting the text into tokens is guided by a predefined dictionary of multi-word expressions, words and phrases. Let's see how the process typically works:\n1. Input Text:We start with a string of text that needs to be tokenized. For example:\n2. Dictionary Lookup:Each word or multi-word expression in the input text is checked against the dictionary. If a word or phrase matches an entry in the dictionary, it is extracted as a single token.\n3. Token Matching:If the word or phrase exists in the dictionary, it is grouped as a token. For example:\n4. Handling Unmatched Words:If a word is not found in the dictionary, it is left as is or further split into smaller components. This can involve:\nSplitting a word into subwords or characters.\nKeeping it as a single token if no dictionary match is found.\nFor example, if a word like \"NLP\" is not in the dictionary, it may be broken into:\n'N' and 'LP' or treated as a special token if predefined in the dictionary.\n5.

    "input": "1. Importing Required Libraries",
    "output": "First, we need to import the necessary libraries such asNLTK,spaCyandNumPyfor handling arrays and processing data."
  },
  {
    "input": "2. Preparing the Dictionary",
    "output": "The key part of dictionary-based tokenization is to have a predefined dictionary that contains multi-word expressions. For example, we will create a custom dictionary containing phrases that should be treated as single tokens like place names, organizations etc."
  },
  {
    "input": "3. Preprocessing the Text",
    "output": "Before tokenizing, we need to clean the text. This may involve removing punctuation marks, stop words or any irrelevant characters to prepare the text for further processing."
  },
  {
    "input": "4. Tokenizing the Text",
    "output": "Next, we split the cleaned text into individual words using a basic tokenizer. This is where the dictionary will come into play, as multi-word expressions should remain intact.\nOutput:"
  },
  {
    "input": "5. Applying Dictionary-Based Tokenization",
    "output": "Now, we apply the dictionary-based tokenization. TheMWETokenizer(Multi-Word Expression Tokenizer) in NLTK helps in grouping multi-word expressions from the predefined dictionary into a single token.\nOutput:"
  },
  {
    "input": "6. Handling Unmatched Tokens",
    "output": "In the tokenization process, words that are not found in the dictionary remain as individual tokens. This helps in keeping the flexibility of the process while ensuring multi-word expressions are correctly tokenized.\nOutput:"

    "input": "7. Example of Dictionary-Based Tokenization in Action",
    "output": "To see dictionary-based tokenization in action, let’s consider the sentence \"San Francisco is part of the United Nations.\"\nOutput:"
  },
  {
    "input": "8. Customizing the Dictionary",
    "output": "If we're working with domain-specific text, we can continuously expand the dictionary to include more multi-word expressions, ensuring accurate tokenization in specialized applications."
  },
  {
    "input": "9. Visualizing Tokenization Output",
    "output": "For better understanding, we can visualize how the dictionary-based tokenization is working over various sentences. This can help confirm whether multi-word expressions are accurately grouped as single tokens.\nOutput:"

    "input": "Challenges and Limitations",
    "output": "By using dictionary-based tokenization, NLP systems can efficiently recognize and process multi-word expressions, enhancing their accuracy and performance across a wide range of language tasks."
