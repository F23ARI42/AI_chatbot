    "output": "Unlike hierarchical clustering KModes requires us to decide the number of clusters (K) in advance. Here's how it works step by step:\nStart by picking clusters:Randomly select K data points from the dataset to act as the starting clusters these are called \"modes\".\nAssign data to clusters:Check how similar each data point is to these clusters using the total number of mismatches and assign each data point to the cluster it matches the most.\nUpdate the clusters:Find the most common value for each cluster and update the cluster centers based on this.\nRepeat the process:Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until no data points are reassigned to different clusters.\nLet X be a set of categorical data objects ofX = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{11}, & ... & x_{1n}\\\\ ... & ... & ...\\\\ x_{n1},& ... & x_{nm} \\end{bmatrix}that can be denoted as and the mode of Z is a vectorQ = [q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{m}]then minimize\nD(X,Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}d(X_{i},Q)\nApply dissimilarity metric equation for data objects\nD(X,Q) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\delta(x_{ij},Q)\nSuppose we want to K cluster Then we have Q =[q_{k1},q_{k2},....,q_{km}] \\epsilon Q\nC(Q) = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\delta(x_{ij},q_{kj})\nOverall the goal of K-modes clustering is to minimize the dissimilarities between the data objects and the centroids (modes) of the clusters using a measure of categorical similarity such as the Hamming distance."

These modes represent the most frequent values in each cluster and are used to group similar rows together."

Let's consider Number of cluster =2.0\nOutputs :\nThis also shows that the first, third, fourth and fifth data points have been assigned to the first cluster and the second data points have been assigned to the second cluster.  So our previous answer was 100 % correct. To find the best number of groups we use the Elbow Method which helps us see when adding more groups doesn't make a big difference. K-Modes is an easy and effective way to group similar data when working with categories"
