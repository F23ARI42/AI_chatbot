    "input": "1. Porter's Stemmer",
    "output": "Porter's Stemmeris one of the most popular and widely used stemming algorithms. Proposed in 1980 by Martin Porter, this stemmer works by applying a series of rules to remove common suffixes from English words. It is well-known for its simplicity, speed and reliability. However, the stemmed output is not guaranteed to be a meaningful word and its applications are limited to the English language.\nExample:\n'agreed' → 'agree'\nRule: If the word has a suffixEED(with at least one vowel and consonant) remove the suffix and change it toEE.\nAdvantages:\nVery fast and efficient.\nCommonly used for tasks like information retrieval and text mining.\nLimitations:\nOutputs may not always be real words.\nLimited to English words.\nNow lets implement Porter's Stemmer in Python, here we will be using NLTK library.\nOutput:"

It is referred to as Porter2 and is faster and more aggressive than its predecessor. One of the key advantages of this is that it supports multiple languages, making it a multilingual stemmer.\nExample:\n'running' → 'run'\n'quickly' → 'quick'\nAdvantages:\nMore efficient than Porter Stemmer.\nSupports multiple languages.\nLimitations:\nMore aggressive which might lead to over-stemming.\nNow lets implement Snowball Stemmer in Python, here we will be using NLTK library.\nOutput:"

    "input": "5.Krovetz Stemmer",
    "output": "The Krovetz Stemmer was developed by Robert Krovetz in 1993. It is designed to be more linguistically accurate and tends to preserve meaning more effectively than other stemmers. It includes steps like converting plural forms to singular and removing ing from past-tense verbs.\nExample:\n'children' → 'child'\n'running' → 'run'\nAdvantages:\nMore accurate, as it preserves linguistic meaning.\nWorks well with both singular/plural and past/present tense conversions.\nLimitations:\nMay be inefficient with large corpora.\nSlower compared to other stemmers."
