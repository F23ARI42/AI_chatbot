The advantage function is defined as:\nA2C helps reduce the variance of the policy gradient, leading to better learning performance.\nAsynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C): A3C is an extension of A2C that uses multiple agents (threads) running in parallel to update the policy asynchronously. This allows for more stable and faster learning by reducing correlations between updates."
