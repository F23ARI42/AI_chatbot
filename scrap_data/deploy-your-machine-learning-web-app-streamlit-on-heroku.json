    "output": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS). It is a cloud platform where one can build, operate and run his/her applications in the cloud itself. Heroku, other than being a very extensive and helpful platform, offers many free plans when you create a new account on the platform. It is great for beginners who are just starting out and trying to learn model deployment to take advantage of the free plans to deploy their model on cloud.\nHave a look at these simple steps to make your web app ready for deployment!"

After creating it, click on the \"Add File\" button on the main branch of your repository and select \"Create New File\" from the drop down options.\nYou have to create 3 such files namely:\nProcfile (Procurement file)\nrequirements.txt (Requirements file)\nsetup.sh (Setup file)\nI hope you can spot the required files in my repository. If you are worried to see files other than these in my repo, let me tell you that you need to upload the app.py file(sentiment-analysis-app.py) and the pickled ML model file (sentiment_analysis_model.p) to run your web app on cloud. It is expected that you already know how to train your Machine Learning model and build a web app for the model using Streamlit before running your eyes through this tutorial. You do not need any other file other than these to deploy your web app on Heroku. However, it is a good practice to upload all the related files of your project in a single repository and that is what I have done here.\n2). Procfile:The Procfile contains the code which gives the commands to tell which files should be executed by the application when it is opened. Open the file you created and type this line of code.\n3). requirements.txtfile contains the list of packages and dependencies needed for running the web app. Below is an example of how you should fill this file.\n4). setup.shfile contains shell script required to set up the shell environment for our purpose. Look at the image below and copy the exact code to your setup.sh file."

But to start theBuild Progressso that your app is finally deployed, you have to follow a little trick.\n2).Go back to your GitHub repository and make any little change so that the build can finally start.\nI would suggest editing the README.md file and making any unnoticeable and irrelevant change.\nAfter you edit your repo and commit changes, the process ofbuild progressbegins."

Simply click onOpen appin the top right corner or copy the app link from theBuild Logto view your app."
