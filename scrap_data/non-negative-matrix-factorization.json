    "input": "Intuition Behind NMF",
    "output": "The goal of NMF is to simplify complex data into a smaller set of meaningful patterns. By choosing a lower dimension k the decomposition highlights essential features while ignoring noise.\nEach data point (column inA) is approximated as a combination of non-negative feature vectors inW.\nThis method assumes that data consists of meaningful parts that add up to form the whole.\nFor example in facial recognition NMF can break down an image into basic facial features such as eyes, nose and mouth. TheWmatrix contains these key features while theHmatrix defines how strongly each image is composed of these features."

Initialization: Start with random non-negative values forWandH.\n2. Iterative Update: ModifyWandHto minimize the difference betweenAandW \\times H.\n3. Stopping Criteria: The process stops when:\nThe reconstruction error stabilizes.\nA set number of iterations is reached.\nCommon optimization techniques for NMF include:\nMultiplicative Update Rules: Ensures non-negativity by iteratively adjustingWandH.\nAlternating Least Squares (ALS): Solves forWwhile keepingHfixed and vice versa, in an alternating manner."

Let's take a case of image processing.\nSuppose we have an input image having pixels that form matrix A.\nUsing NMF we factorize it into two matrices one containing the facial feature set [Matrix W]\nOther contains the importance of each facial feature in the input image i.e. the weights [Matrix H].
