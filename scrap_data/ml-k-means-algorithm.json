For the next centroids:\nIt calculates thedistance of every point to its nearest existing centroid.\nChooses the pointfarthest from the nearest centroidas the next centroid and ensures centroids are spaced far apart initially, giving better cluster separation.\n\nOutput:\nIt shows the dataset with the first randomly selected centroid (in red). No black points are visible since only one centroid is selected.\nThe second centroid is selected which is the farthest point from the first centroid. The first centroid becomes black and the new centroid is marked in red\nThe third centroid is selected. The two previously selected centroids are shown in black while the newly selected centroid is in red.\nThe final centroid is selected completing the initialization. Three previously selected centroids are in black and the last selected centroid is in red."

This is useful in computer vision applications, such as object recognition or tracking.\nCustomer segmentation: These are used to group customers into different segments based on their purchasing habits, demographic data, or other characteristics. This is useful in marketing and advertising applications, as it can help businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively.\nRecommender systems: K-means++ can be used to recommend products or services to users based on their past purchases or preferences. This is useful in e-commerce and online advertising applications."
