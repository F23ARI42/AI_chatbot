    "output": "The Elbow Method works in the following steps:\n1. We iterate over a range of k values, typically from 1 to n (where n is a hyperparameter you choose).\n2. For each k, we calculate a distance measure called WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares). This tells us how spread out the data points are within each cluster.\nWCSS measures how well the data points are clustered around their respective centroids. It is defined as the sum of the squared distances between each point and its cluster centroid:\nwhere:\n\\text{distance}(x_j^{(i)}, c_i)represents the distance between thej^{th}data pointx_j^{(i)}​ in cluster i and the centroidc_iof that cluster.\n3. We try different k values (number of clusters). For each k, we run KMeans and calculate the WCSS.\n4. We plot a graph with k on the X-axis and WCSS on the Y-axis.\n5. As we increase k, the WCSS typically decreases because we're creating more clusters, which tend to capture more data variations. However, there comes a point where adding more clusters results in only a marginal decrease in WCSS. This is where we observe an \"elbow\" shape in the graph.\nBefore the elbow: Increasing k significantly reduces WCSS, indicating that new clusters effectively capture more of the data's variability.\nAfter the elbow: Adding more clusters results in a minimal reduction in WCSS, suggesting that these extra clusters may not be necessary and could lead to overfitting.\nThe goal is to identify the point where the rate of decrease in WCSS sharply changes, indicating that adding more clusters (beyond this point) yields diminishing returns. This \"elbow\" point suggests the optimal number of clusters."

A lower distortion value indicates better clustering.\nwhere,\nx_i​ is thei^{th}data point\ncis a cluster center from the set of all cluster centroids\n\\left\\| x_i - c \\right\\|^2is the squared Euclidean distance between the data point and the cluster center\nnis the total number of data points"

    "input": "2. Inertia",
    "output": "Inertia is the sum of squared distances of each data point to its closest cluster center. It's essentially the total squared error of the clustering. Like distortion, a lower inertia value suggests better clustering.\nIn the Elbow Method, we calculate the distortion or inertia for different values of k (number of clusters). We then plot these values to identify the \"elbow point\", where the rate of decrease in distortion or inertia starts to slow down. This elbow point often indicates the optimal number of clusters."
