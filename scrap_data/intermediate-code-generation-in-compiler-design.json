    "input": "What is Intermediate Code Generation?",
    "output": "Intermediate Code Generation is a stage in the process of compiling a program, where the compiler translates the source code into an intermediate representation. This representation is not machine code but is simpler than the original high-level code. Here’s how it works:\nTranslation:The compiler takes the high-level code (like C orJava) and converts it into an intermediate form, which can be easier to analyze and manipulate.\nPortability: This intermediate code can often run on different types of machines without needing major changes, making it more versatile.\nOptimization:Before turning it into machine code, the compiler can optimize this intermediate code to make the final program run faster or use less memory.\nIf we generate machine code directly from source code then for n target machine we will have optimizers and n code generator but if we will have a machine-independent intermediate code, we will have only one optimizer. Intermediate code can be either language-specific (e.g., Bytecode for Java) or language. independent (three-address code). The following are commonly used intermediate code representations:"

    "input": "Syntax Tree",
    "output": "A syntax tree serves as a condensed representation of a parse tree.\nThe operator and keyword nodes present in the parse tree undergo a relocation process to become part of their respective parent nodes in the syntax tree.  the internal nodes are operators and child nodes are operands.\nCreating asyntax treeinvolves strategically placing parentheses within the expression. This technique contributes to a more intuitive representation, making it easier to discern the sequence in which operands should be processed.\nThe syntax tree not only condenses theparse treebut also offers an improved visual representation of the program's syntactic structure,Example:x = (a + b * c) / (a - b * c)"
