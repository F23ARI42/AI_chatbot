    "input": "What isCovariance?",
    "output": "Covariance is a statistical which measures the relationship between a pair of random variables where a change in one variable causes a change in another variable. It assesses how much two variables change together from their mean values. Covariance is calculated by taking the average of the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means. Covariance helps us understand the direction of the relationship but not how strong it is because the number depends on the units used. It’s an important tool to see how two things are connected."

When working with a sample, we divide byn - 1to correct for the bias introduced by estimating the population covariance based on the sample data. This is known as Bessel's correction.\nWhere:\nX_i​: Thei^{th}value of the variableXin the population.\nY_i​: Thei^{th}value of the variableYin the population.\n\\mu_X: The population mean of variableX(i.e., the average of allX_i​ values in the population).\n\\mu_Y: The population mean of variableY(i.e., the average of allY_i​ values in the population).\nn: The total number of data points in the population.\n\\sum: The summation symbol means we sum the products of the deviations for all the data points.\nn: In the case of population covariance, we divide bynbecause we are using the entire population data. There’s no need for Bessel’s correction since we’re not estimating anything."

    "output": "Positive Covariance: When one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase as well and vice versa.\nNegative Covariance: When one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\nZero Covariance: There is no linear relationship between the two variables; they move independently of each other."

    "output": "Correlation is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is derived from covariance and ranges between -1 and 1. Unlike covariance, which only indicates the direction of the relationship, correlation provides a standardized measure.\nPositive Correlation (close to +1): As one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase.\nNegative Correlation (close to -1): As one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.\nZero Correlation: There is no linear relationship between the variables.\nThecorrelation coefficient\\rho(rho) for variables X and Y is defined as:"
