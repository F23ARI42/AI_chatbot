The method of finding the mean is also different depending on the type of data. Data is of two types,grouped dataandungrouped data.  The mean is generally the average of a given set of numbers or data. It is one of the most important measures of the central tendency of distributed data.\nIt is calculated by adding all the numbers in the data set and dividing by the number of values in the set. The mean is also known as theaverage. It is sensitive to skewed data and extreme values. For example, when the data is skewed, it can miss the mark."

Let's take a look at the different cases to find the mean:\nCase 1:If there are 'n' number of items in a list. The data is {x1, x2, x3, ... xn}.
