    "output": "Neural networkconsists of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons that collaborate to process input data. In afully connected deep neural networkdata flows through multiple layers where each neuron performs nonlinear transformations, allowing the model to learn intricate representations of the data.\nIn a deep neural network theinput layerreceives data which passes throughhidden layersthat transform the data using nonlinear functions. The finaloutput layergenerates the modelâ€™s prediction."

    "input": "Evolution of Neural Architectures",
    "output": "The journey of deep learning began with theperceptron, a single-layer neural network introduced in the 1950s. While innovative, perceptrons could only solve linearly separable problems hence failing at more complex tasks like the XOR problem.\nThis limitation led to the development ofMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). It introduced hidden layers and non-linear activation functions. MLPs trained usingbackpropagationcould model complex, non-linear relationships marking a significant leap in neural network capabilities. This evolution from perceptrons to MLPs laid the groundwork for advanced architectures like CNNs and RNNs, showcasing the power of layered structures in solving real-world problems."
