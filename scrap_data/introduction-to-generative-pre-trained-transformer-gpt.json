    "output": "GPT models are built upon the transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, allowing for efficient handling of long-range dependencies in text. The core process involves:\nThis two-step approach enables GPTs to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide array of topics and tasks."

    "input": "Architecture",
    "output": "Let's explore the architecture:\n1. Input Embedding\nInput: The raw text input is tokenized into individual tokens (words or subwords).\nEmbedding: Each token is converted into a dense vector representation using an embedding layer.\n2. Positional Encoding:Since transformers do not inherently understand the order of tokens,positional encodingsare added to the input embeddings to retain the sequence information.\n3. Dropout Layer:A dropout layer is applied to the embeddings to prevent overfitting during training.\n4. Transformer Blocks\nLayerNorm: Each transformer block starts with a layer normalization.\nMulti-Head Self-Attention:Multi-Head Self-Attentionare core component where the input passes through multiple attention heads.\nAdd & Norm: The output of the attention mechanism is added back to the input (residual connection) and normalized again.\nFeed-Forward Network: A position-wiseFeed-Forward Networkis applied, typically consisting of two linear transformations with a GeLU activation in between.\nDropout:Dropoutis applied to the feed-forward network output.\n5. Layer Stack:The transformer blocks are stacked to form a deeper model, allowing the network to capture more complex patterns and dependencies in the input.\n6. Final Layers\nLayerNorm:LayerNormis final layer normalization is applied.\nLinear: The output is passed through a linear layer to map it to the vocabulary size.\nSoftmax: ASoftmaxlayer is applied to produce the final probabilities for each token in the vocabulary."

    "input": "Background and Evolution",
    "output": "The progress of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models by OpenAI has been marked by significant advancements in natural language processing. Here’s a overview:\n1. GPT (2018):The original model had 12 layers, 768 hidden units, 12 attention heads (≈ 117 million parameters). It introduced the idea of unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning on downstream tasks.\n2. GPT-2 (2019):Scaled up to as many as 1.5 billion parameters. It showed strong generative abilities (generating coherent passages), prompting initial concerns about misuse.\n3. GPT-3 (2020):Massive jump to ~175 billion parameters. Introduced stronger few-shot and zero-shot capabilities, reducing the need for task-specific training.\n4. GPT-4 (2023):Improved in reasoning, context retention, multimodal abilities (in some variants) and better alignment.\n5. GPT-4.5 (2025):Introduced as a bridge between GPT-4 and GPT-5, it included better steerability, nuance and conversational understanding.\n6. GPT-4.1 (2025):Released in April 2025, offering enhancements in coding performance, long-context comprehension (up to 1 million tokens) and instruction following.\n7. GPT-5 (2025):The newest major release. GPT-5 is a unified system that dynamically routes queries between a fast model and a “thinking” deeper model to optimize for both speed and depth.\nIt demonstrates improved performance across reasoning, coding, multimodality and safety benchmarks.\nGPT-5 also better mitigates hallucinations, sees stronger instruction-following fidelity and shows more reliable domain reasoning.\nIn medical imaging tasks, GPT-5 achieves significant gains over GPT-4o, e.g. up to +20 % in some anatomical region reasoning benchmarks.\nBecause the field is rapidly evolving, newer intermediate or specialized models (e.g. reasoning-only models or domain-tuned variants) are also emerging, but GPT-5 currently represents the headline advancement."
