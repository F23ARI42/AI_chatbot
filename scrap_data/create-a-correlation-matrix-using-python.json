We can use thenp.corrcoef()function to find the correlation between two or more variables.\nExample: A daily sales and temperature record is kept by an ice cream store. To find the relationship between sales and temperature, we can utilize the NumPy library where x is sales in dollars and y is the daily temperature.\nOutput:"

As one changes, the other does not follow any predictable pattern.\nPositive Correlation: A value closer to +1 indicates a direct relationship as one variable increases, the other also increases. Example: height and weight.\nNegative Correlation: A value closer to -1 indicates an inverse relationship as one variable increases, the other decreases. Example: speed and travel time."
