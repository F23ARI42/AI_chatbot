    "output": "A Voronoi diagram splits space into regions based on which training point is closest.\nEach region called a Voronoi cell contains all the points closest to one specific training point.\nThe lines between regions are where points are equally close to two or more seeds. These are the decision boundaries for 1-Nearest Neighbour which is very irregular in shape.\nIf we label the training points by class the Voronoi diagram shows how KNN assigns a new point based on which region it falls into.\nThe boundary line between two pointsp_iandp_jis the perpendicular bisector of the line joining them meaning it’s a line that cuts the segment between them exactly in half at a right angle."

    "input": "Relationship Between KNN Decision Boundaries and Voronoi Diagrams",
    "output": "In two-dimensional space the decision boundaries of KNN can be visualized as Voronoi diagrams. Here’s how:\nKNN Boundaries:The decision boundary for KNN is determined by regions where the classification changes based on the nearest neighbors. K approaches infinity, these boundaries approach the Voronoi diagram boundaries.\nVoronoi Diagram as a Special Case:When k = 1 KNN’s decision boundaries directly correspond to the Voronoi diagram of the training points. Each region in the Voronoi diagram represents the area where the nearest training point is closest."

    "input": "How KNN Defines Decision Boundaries",
    "output": "In KNN, decision boundaries are influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used:\n1. Impact of 'K' on Decision Boundaries: The number of neighbors (k) affects the shape and smoothness of the decision boundary.\nSmall k:When k is small the decision boundary can become very complex, closely following the training data. This can lead to overfitting.\nLarge k:When k is large the decision boundary smooths out and becomes less sensitive to individual data points, potentially leading to underfitting.\n2. Distance Metric: The decision boundary is also affected by the distance metric used like Euclidean, Manhattan. Different metrics can lead to different boundary shapes.\nEuclidean Distance:Commonly used leading to circular or elliptical decision boundaries in two-dimensional space.\nManhattan Distance:Results in axis-aligned decision boundaries."

    "output": "Consider abinary classificationproblem with two features where the goal is to visualize how KNN decision boundary changes as k varies. This example uses synthetic data to illustrate the impact of different k values on the decision boundary.\nFor a two-dimensional dataset decision boundary can be plotted by:\nCreating a Grid: Generate a grid of points covering the feature space.\nClassifying Grid Points:Use the KNN algorithm to classify each point in the grid based on its neighbors.\nPlotting:Color the grid points according to their class labels and draw the boundaries where the class changes.\nOutput:\nFor small k the boundary is highly sensitive to local variations and can be irregular.\nFor larger k the boundary smooths out, reflecting a more generalized view of the data distribution."

    "input": "Factors That Affect KNN Decision Boundaries",
    "output": "Feature Scaling: KNN is sensitive to the scale of data. Features with larger ranges can dominate distance calculations, affecting the boundary shape.\nNoise in Data: Outliers and noisy data points can shift or distort decision boundaries, leading to incorrect classifications.\nData Distribution: How data points are spread across the feature space influences how KNN separates classes.\nBoundary Shape: A clear and accurate boundary improves classification accuracy, while a messy or unclear boundary can lead to errors.\nUnderstanding these boundaries helps in optimizing KNN's performance for specific datasets."
