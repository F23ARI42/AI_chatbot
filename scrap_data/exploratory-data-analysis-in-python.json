This gives an overview of the dataset's size and structure.\nOutput:\n2. df.info():This function helps us to understand the dataset by showing the number of records in each column, type of data, whether any values are missing and how much memory the dataset uses.\nOutput:\n3. df.describe().T: This method gives a statistical summary of the DataFrame (Transpose) showing values like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and quartiles for each numerical column. It helps in summarizing the central tendency and spread of the data.\nOutput:\n4.df.columns.tolist():This converts the column names of the DataFrame into a Python list making it easy to access and manipulate the column names.\nOutput:"

Bar Plot for evaluating the count of the wine with its quality rate.\nOutput:\nHere, this count plot graph shows the count of the wine with its quality rate.\n2.Kernel density plotfor understanding variance in the dataset\nOutput:\nThe features in the dataset with a skewness of0shows a symmetrical distribution. If the skewness is 1 or above it suggests a positively skewed (right-skewed) distribution. In a right-skewed distribution the tail extends more to the right which shows the presence of extremely high values.\n3.Swarm Plotfor showing the outlier in the data\nOutput:\nThis graph shows the swarm plot for the 'Quality' and 'Alcohol' columns. The higher point density in certain areas shows where most of the data points are concentrated. Points that are isolated and far from these clusters represent outliers highlighting uneven values in the dataset."

    "input": "Step 7: Bivariate Analysis",

This method helps in understanding how changes in one variable might affect another.\nLet's visualize these relationships by plotting various plot for the data which will show how the variables interact with each other across multiple dimensions.\n1. Pair Plot for showing the distribution of the individual variables\nOutput:\nIf the plot is diagonal , histograms of kernel density plots shows the distribution of the individual variables.\nIf the scatter plot is in the lower triangle, it displays the relationship between the pairs of the variables.\nIf the scatter plots above and below the diagonal are mirror images indicating symmetry.\nIf the histogram plots are more centered, it represents the locations of peaks.\nSkewness is found by observing whether the histogram is symmetrical or skewed to the left or right.\n2.Violin Plotfor examining the relationship between alcohol and Quality.\nOutput:\nFor interpreting the Violin Plot:\nIf the width is wider, it shows higher density suggesting more data points.\nSymmetrical plot shows a balanced distribution.\nPeak or bulge in the violin plot represents most common value in distribution.\nLonger tails shows great variability.\nMedian line is the middle line inside the violin plot. It helps in understanding central tendencies.\n3. Box Plot for examining the relationship between alcohol and Quality\nOutput:\nBox represents theIQRi.e longer the box, greater the variability.\nMedian line in the box shows central tendency.\nWhiskersextend from box to the smallest and largest values within a specified range.\nIndividual points beyond the whiskers represents outliers.\nA compact box shows low variability while a stretched box shows higher variability."

    "output": "It involves finding the interactions between three or more variables in a dataset at the same time. This approach focuses to identify complex patterns, relationships and interactions which provides understanding of how multiple variables collectively behave and influence each other.\nHere, we are going to show the multivariate analysis using acorrelation matrix plot.\nOutput:\nValues close to +1 shows strong positive correlation, -1 shows a strong negative correlation and 0 suggests no linear correlation.\nDarker colors signify strong correlation, while light colors represents weaker correlations.\nPositive correlation variable move in same directions. As one increases, the other also increases.\nNegative correlation variable move in opposite directions. An increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other.\nWith these insights from the EDA, we are now ready to undertsand the data and explore more advanced modeling techniques."
