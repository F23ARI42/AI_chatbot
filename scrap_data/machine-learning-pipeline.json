    "output": "AMachine LearningPipelineis a systematic workflow designed to automate the process ofbuilding, training, and deploying ofML models. It includes several steps, such asdata collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation and deployment.\nRather than managing each step individually, pipelines help simplify and standardize the workflow, making machine learning developmentfaster, more efficient and scalable. They also enhance data management by enabling the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from various sources."
