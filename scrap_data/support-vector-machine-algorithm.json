    "input": "How does Support Vector Machine Algorithm Work?",
    "output": "The key idea behind the SVM algorithm is to find the hyperplane that best separates two classes by maximizing the margin between them. This margin is the distance from the hyperplane to the nearest data points (support vectors) on each side.\nThe best hyperplane also known as the\"hard margin\"is the one that maximizes the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from both classes. This ensures a clear separation between the classes. So from the above figure, we choose L2 as hard margin. Let's consider a scenario like shown below:\nHere, we have one blue ball in the boundary of the red ball."

  {
    "input": "How does SVM classify the data?",
    "output": "The blue ball in the boundary of red ones is an outlier of blue balls. The SVM algorithm has the characteristics to ignore the outlier and finds the best hyperplane that maximizes the margin. SVM is robust to outliers.\nA soft margin allows for some misclassifications or violations of the margin to improve generalization. The SVM optimizes the following equation to balance margin maximization and penalty minimization:\n\\text{Objective Function} = (\\frac{1}{\\text{margin}}) + \\lambda \\sum \\text{penalty }\nThe penalty used for violations is oftenhinge losswhich has the following behavior:\nIf a data point is correctly classified and within the margin there is no penalty (loss = 0).\nIf a point is incorrectly classified or violates the margin the hinge loss increases proportionally to the distance of the violation.\nTill now we were talking about linearly separable data that seprates group of blue balls and red balls by a straight line/linear line."

    "input": "What if data is not linearly separable?",
    "output": "When data is not linearly separable i.e it can't be divided by a straight line, SVM uses a technique calledkernelsto map the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes separable. This transformation helps SVM find a decision boundary even for non-linear data.\nA kernel is a function that maps data points into a higher-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates in that space. This allows SVM to work efficiently with non-linear data by implicitly performing the mapping. For example consider data points that are not linearly separable. By applying a kernel function SVM transforms the data points into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable.\nLinear Kernel: For linear separability.\nPolynomial Kernel: Maps data into a polynomial space.\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Transforms data into a space based on distances between data points.\nIn this case the new variable y is created as a function of distance from the origin."

When the data can be precisely linearly separated, linear SVMs are very suitable. This means that a single straight line (in 2D) or a hyperplane (in higher dimensions) can entirely divide the data points into their respective classes. A hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes is the decision boundary.\nNon-Linear SVM:Non-Linear SVMcan be used to classify data when it cannot be separated into two classes by a straight line (in the case of 2D). By using kernel functions, nonlinear SVMs can handle nonlinearly separable data. The original input data is transformed by these kernel functions into a higher-dimensional feature space where the data points can be linearly separated.
