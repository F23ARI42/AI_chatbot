    "input": "What is Machine Learning?",
    "output": "Machine learningis a subset ofartificial intelligencethat allows computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. As they process more data,machine learning algorithmsevolve and adapt rather than rely on static programming. Machine learning’s ability to “learn” is what gives it its power especially when dealing with complex patterns, high data volumes, or uncertain results.\nThere aredifferent types of machine learning techniques:\nSupervised learning\nUnsupervised learning\nSemi-supervised Learning\nReinforcement learning"

    "input": "1. Google Search",
    "output": "Google Searchhas changed so much with machine learning. One of the big changes wasRankBrainin 2015 which helps Google understand ambiguous and long tail queries.RankBrainuses machine learning to show relevant results based on past user behavior even with never before seen search terms. In 2019,BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) took it a step further and helped the system understand context especially in natural language. It reads words in relation to each other and refines results based on subtle interpretations. These innovations mean users get the most accurate and contextually relevant results even when they search with vague or uncommon phrases"

    "output": "Machine learning is key toGoogle Mapsreal time navigation. By analyzing massive amounts of historical data and real time inputs such astraffic speed,accidentsandroad closures,Google Maps predicts the best routes. The addition ofreinforcement learningallows Maps to adapt and refine its predictions over time. It learns from millions of user interactions, taking into account things liketime of day, construction zonesandweatherto suggest the best routes. This dynamic learning system means users get the most up-to-date routes even in complex urban environments and improves the overall experience."
