    "input": "What is Machine Learning?",
    "output": "Machine Learningis a type of technology that helps computers learn from data and make decisions on their own just like humans learn from experience. Instead of giving a computer step-by-step instructions for every task, we give it lots of data and let it learn patterns and rules from that data. For example, if we want a computer to recognize photos of cats, we don’t have to tell it what a cat looks like. Instead, we show it many pictures of cats and non-cats. Over time, the computer learns the difference and can say, “This is a cat!” when it sees a new photo.\nMachine Learning is used in many everyday things like voice assistants (like Siri or Alexa), online recommendations (like YouTube or Amazon), and even self-driving cars. It’s all about helping machines get smarter over time by learning from the data they see."

    "input": "1. Google",
    "output": "Rather than wondering \"Which Google applications use ML?\" it is better to ask the question \"Do any Google Applications not use ML?\". And the answer is most probably no!!! Google is heavily invested inMachine Learning Researchand plans to eventually integrate it fully in all its products. Even currently, ML is used in all Google flagship products likeGoogle Search, Google Translate, Google Photos, Google Assistant, etc.Google Search usesRankBrainwhich is adeepneural networkthat helps in providing the required search results. In case there are any unique words or phrases on Google Search (like \"CEO of Apple\") then RankBrain makes intelligent guesses to find out that your search probably means \"Tim Cook\". Google Translate, on the other hand, analyses millions of documents that are already translated from one language to another and then looks for the common patterns and basic vocabulary of the language.Google Photos usesImage Recognition, wherein Deep Learning is used to sort millions of images on the internet in order to classify them more accurately. Google Assistant also uses Image Recognition andNatural Language Processingto appear as a multitalented assistant that can answer all your questions!"

    "input": "2. Facebook",
    "output": "Facebook is themost popular social networking site in the worldwith2.41 BillionMonthly Active Users! If you want to check out your friends, follow celebrities or watch cat photos, Facebook is the place to go! And this level of popularity is only possible with the help of Machine Learning. Facebook using ML in everything ranging from its News Feed to even Targeted Advertising.Facebook usesFacial Recognitionto recognize your friends on social media and suggest their names. If you have your “tag suggestions” or “face recognition” turned on in Facebook then the Machine Learning System analyses the pixels of the face in the image and creates a template that is unique for every face. This facial fingerprint can then be used to detect the face again and suggest a tag.And targeted advertising on Facebook is done usingdeep neural networksthat analyze your age, gender, location, page likes, interests, etc. to profile you into select categories and then show you ads specifically targeted toward these categories. Facebook also uses Chatbots now that provide you with human-like customer support interactions. These chatbots use ML and NLP to interact with the users and appear almost like humans."

    "input": "3. Twitter",
    "output": "Twitter is the goto place for interesting tweets and intelligent debates! Want to know about the current political climate, dangers of global warming, smart comments from favorite celebrities, then go to Twitter! And guess how all these tweets are managed? That's right, using Machine Learning!\nTwitter uses anML algorithmto organize the tweets on your timeline. Tweets based on the type of content you like as well as tweets posted by friends, family, and so on are given higher priority and appear on your higher on your feed. Also, tweets that are quite popular with lots of retweets or likes have a higher chance of visibility. You may also see some of these tweets in the“In case you missed it”section. Earlier, the tweets were arranged in a reverse chronological order, which is popular with some people as they are demanding it back! Currently, Twitter is also using theNatural Language Processingcapabilities of IBM Watson to track and delete the abusive tweets generated.\nTwitter also usesdeep learningto identify what is going on in the live feed. This is done by training the neural network to recognize the images in the videos using tags. Suppose you put the tags “Dog”, “Animal”, “Pug” etc. in your video, the algorithm can identify that this is a dog and then use this to identify dogs in other videos."

    "input": "4. Baidu",
    "output": "BaiduisGoogle for China! While that is not strictly true, Baidu is a Chinese Search Engine that is most commonly compared to Google. And just like Google, it also uses Machine Learning in many of its applications likeBaidu Search, DuerOSwhich is Baidu’s voice assistant, theXiaoyu Zaikia(Little Fish) home robot which is like Alexa.\nNow, the primaryfocus of Baidu is its Search Engine as 75% of Chinese people use this. So Machine Learning Algorithms are used forvoice recognitionandimage recognitionto provide the best possible (and smarter!) service. Baidu has also invested heavily in natural language processing, which is visible inDuerOS.\nDuerOS is Baidu's voice assistant, which usesnatural language processingalong with voice and image recognition to create a smart system that can hold a full conversation with you while sounding like a human. This voice assistant uses ML to understand the complexities in human language and then copy it perfectly. Another application of Baidu’s mastery of NLP is the Little Fish home robot which is like Alexa, but also different. It can turn its head to “listen” in the direction the voice is coming from and respond accordingly!"

    "input": "5. Pinterest",
    "output": "In case you want to pin the images, videos, and GIFs that interest you,Pinterestis the place for it! And whether you are a regular pinner or just a novice, Pinterest’s immense popularity guarantees you have heard its name. Now, since this application is dependent on saving images from the internet, it stands to reason that its most important feature would be to identify images.\nAnd that’s where Machine Learning comes in! Pinterest usingImage Recognition algorithmsto identify the patterns in an image you have pinned so that similar images are displayed when you search for them. Suppose you have pinned a green shirt, you will be able to view images of more green shirts using Image Recognition. But Pinterest doesn’t guarantee if these green shirts are fashionable or not!!!\nAnother application of ML is that Pinterest provides you morepersonalized recommendationsbased on your personal Pinning history. This is different than ML algorithms for other social networking applications that also factor in your friends, age, gender, etc."

    "input": "Conclusion",
    "output": "Machine Learningis now a big part of how companies make their products smarter and more helpful for users. Whether it's Google showing you better search results, Facebook recognizing your friends in photos, or Pinterest suggesting new pins you might like, all of this is made possible with Machine Learning. As more and more companies use this technology, we’ll continue to see better, faster, and more personalized services in our daily lives. Machine Learning is not just the future, it’s already happening all around us!"
