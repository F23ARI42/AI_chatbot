    "input": "Processes Involved in Feature Engineering",
    "output": "Lets see various features involved in feature engineering:\n1. Feature Creation: Feature creation involves generating new features from domain knowledge or by observing patterns in the data. It can be:\n2. Feature Transformation: Transformation adjusts features to improve model learning:\n3. Feature Extraction: Extracting meaningful features can reduce dimensionality and improve model accuracy:\nDimensionality reduction: Techniques like PCA reduce features while preserving important information.\nAggregation & Combination: Summing or averaging features to simplify the model.\n4. Feature Selection: Feature selection involves choosing a subset of relevant features to use:\nFilter methods: Based on statistical measures like correlation.\nWrapper methods: Select based on model performance.\nEmbedded methods: Feature selection integrated within model training.\n5. Feature Scaling: Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model:\nMin-Max scaling: Rescales values to a fixed range like 0 to 1.\nStandard scaling: Normalizes to have a mean of 0 and variance of 1."
