    "output": "Instead of explicitly computing the transformation the kernel computes the dot product of data points in the higher-dimensional space directly that helps a model find patterns in complex data and transforming the data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes easier to separate different classes or detect relationships.\nFor example, suppose we have data points shaped like two concentric circles: one circle represents one class and the other circle represents another class. If we try to separate these classes with a straight line it can't be done because the data is not linearly separable in its current form.\nWhen we use a kernel function it transforms the original 2D data like the concentric circles into a higher-dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable. In that higher-dimensional space the SVM finds a simple straight-line decision boundary to separate the classes.\nWhen we bring this straight-line decision boundary back to the original 2D space it no longer looks like a straight line. Instead, it appears as a circular boundary that perfectly separates the two classes. This happens because the kernel trick allows the SVM to \"see\" the data in a new way enabling it to draw a boundary that fits the original shape of the data."

It is widely used as it creates flexible decision boundary.\nLinear Kernel: Works for data that is linearly separable problem without complex transformations.\nPolynomial Kernel: Models more complex relationships using polynomial equations.\nSigmoid Kernel: Mimics neural network behavior using sigmoid function and is suitable for specific non-linear problems.\nBelow are some examples of Non-Linear SVM Classification."
