    "output": "In artificial intelligence (AI), reasoning mechanisms refer to the processes and methods that enable AI systems to make sense of information, draw conclusions, solve problems, and make decisions. These mechanisms are designed to mimic human cognitive abilities, allowing computers to handle tasks that require logical thought, understanding, and inference.\nReasoning in AI involves the ability to process structured or unstructured input data, apply logical rules or learned knowledge, and produce outputs that are logically consistent with the inputs and the applied rules. This can include interpreting new data, predicting outcomes, identifying patterns, and generating explanations for decisions."
