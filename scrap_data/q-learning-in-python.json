It is a table of Q-values representing the agent's understanding of the environment. As the agent explores and learns from its interactions with the environment, it updates the Q-table. The Q-table helps the agent make informed decisions by showing which actions are likely to lead to better rewards.\nStructure of a Q-table:\nRows represent the states.\nColumns represent the possible actions.\nEach entry in the table corresponds to the Q-value for a state-action pair.\nOver time, as the agent learns and refines its Q-values through exploration and exploitation, the Q-table evolves to reflect the best actions for each state, leading to optimal decision-making."
