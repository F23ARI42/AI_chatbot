    "input": "Step 2: Inspect Data Structure and Check Missing Values",
    "output": "We understand dataset size, data types and identify any incomplete (missing) data that needs handling.\ndf.info():Prints concise summary including count of non-null entries and data type of each column.\ndf.isnull().sum():Returns the number of missing values per column.\nOutput:"

    "input": "Step 3: Statistical Summary and Visualizing Outliers",
    "output": "Get numeric summaries like mean, median, min/max and detect unusual points (outliers). Outliers can skew models if not handled.\ndf.describe():Computes count, mean, std deviation, min/max and quartiles for numerical columns.\nBoxplots:Visualize spread and detect outliers using matplotlib’s boxplot().\nOutput:"

    "output": "Remove extreme values beyond a reasonable range to improve model robustness.\nIQR = Q3 (75th percentile) – Q1 (25th percentile).\nValues below Q1 - 1.5IQR or above Q3 + 1.5IQR are outliers.\nCalculate lower and upper bounds for each column separately.\nFilter data points to keep only those within bounds."

Correlation helps gauge feature importance.\ndf.corr():Computes pairwise correlation coefficients between columns.\nHeatmap via seaborn visualizes correlation matrix clearly.\nSorting correlations with corr['Outcome'].sort_values() highlights features most correlated with the target.\nOutput:"

    "output": "Scale features to a common range or distribution, important for many ML algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.\n1. Normalization (Min-Max Scaling):Rescales features between 0 and 1. Good for algorithms like k-NN and neural networks.\nClass:MinMaxScaler from sklearn.\n.fit_transform():Learns min/max from data and applies scaling.\nOutput:\n2. Standardization:Transforms features to have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1, useful for normally distributed features.\nClass:StandardScaler from sklearn.\nOutput:"
