    "output": "Bootstrap Sampling: From the original dataset, multiple training subsets are created by sampling with replacement. This generates diverse data views, reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.\nBase Model Training:Each bootstrap sample trains an independent base learner (e.g., decision trees, SVMs, neural networks). These “weak learners” may not perform well alone but contribute to ensemble strength. Training happens in parallel, making bagging efficient.\nAggregation: Once trained, each base model generates predictions on new data. For classification, predictions are combined via majority voting; for regression, predictions are averaged to produce the final outcome.\nOut-of-Bag (OOB) Evaluation: Samples excluded from a particular bootstrap subset (called out-of-bag samples) provide a natural validation set for that base model. OOB evaluation offers an unbiased performance estimate without additional cross-validation.\nBagging starts with the original training dataset.\nFrom this, bootstrap samples (random subsets with replacement) are created. These samples are used to train multiple weak learners, ensuring diversity.\nEach weak learner independently predicts outcomes, capturing different patterns.\nPredictions are aggregated using majority voting, where the most voted output becomes the final classification.\nOut-of-Bag (OOB) evaluation measures model performance using data not included in each bootstrap sample.\nOverall, this approach improves accuracy and reduces overfitting."

  },
  {
    "input": "Advantages",
    "output": "Improved Predictive Performance: By combining multiple base models trained on different subsets of the data, bagging reduces overfitting and notably increases predictive accuracy compared to single classifiers.\nRobustness: Aggregating predictions from multiple models reduces the impact of outliers and noise in the data, resulting in a more stable and reliable overall model.\nReduced Variance: Since each base model is trained on a different bootstrap sample, the ensemble’s variance is significantly lower than that of individual models, leading to better generalization.\nFlexibility: It can be applied to a wide variety of base learners such as decision trees, support vector machines and neural networks, making it a versatile ensemble technique."
  },
  {
    "input": "Disadvantages",
    "output": "No Bias Reduction: Bagging primarily reduces variance but does not improve or reduce bias. So if the base models are biased, bagging will not correct that and the overall error might still be high.\nPotential Overfitting in Some Cases: Although bagging generally reduces overfitting, if the base learners are too complex and not properly regularized, ensemble models can still overfit.\nLimited Improvement for Stable Models: For base learners that are already stable (low variance), such as linear models, bagging may not yield significant performance gains.\nHyperparameter Sensitivity: Selecting the right number of estimators and other parameters is important; improper tuning can lead to suboptimal results or wasted resources."
