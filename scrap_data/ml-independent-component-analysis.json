    "output": "To better understand how Independent Component Analysis (ICA) works letâ€™s look at a classic example known as the Cocktail Party Problem\nHere there is a party going into a room full of people.\nThere is 'n' number of speakers in that room and they are speaking simultaneously at the party.\nIn the same room, there are also 'n' microphones placed at different distances from the speakers which are recording 'n' speakers' voice signals.\nHence the number of speakers is equal to the number of microphones in the room. Now using these microphones' recordings, we want to separate all the 'n' speakers voice signals in the room given that each microphone recorded the voice signals coming from each speaker of different intensity due to the difference in distances between them.\nDecomposing the mixed signal of each microphone's recording into an independent source's speech signal can be done by using the machine learning technique independent component analysis.\nwhereX_1, X_2, \\dots, X_nare the original signals present in the mixed signal andY_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_nare the new features and are independent components that are independent of each other."

If the sources are mixed nonlinearly ICA may not be effective.\nComputationally Expensive:This can be computationally expensive especially for large datasets which make it difficult to apply ICA to real-world problems."
