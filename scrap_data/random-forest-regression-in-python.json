    "output": "Random Forest Regression works by creating multiple ofdecision treeseach trained on a random subset of the data. The process begins withBootstrap samplingwhere random rows of data are selected with replacement to form different training datasets for each tree. After this we dofeature samplingwhere only a random subset of features is used to build each tree ensuring diversity in the models.\nAfter the trees are trained each tree make a prediction and the final prediction for regression tasks is the average of all the individual tree predictions and this process is called asAggregation.\nThis approach is beneficial because individual decision trees may have high variance and are prone to overfitting especially with complex data. However by averaging the predictions from multiple decision trees Random Forest minimizes this variance leading to more accurate and stable predictions and hence improving generalization of model."

    "output": "Complexity: It can be computationally expensive and slow to train especially with a large number of trees and high-dimensional data. Due to this it may not be suitable for real-time predictions especially with a large number of trees.\nLess Interpretability: Since it uses many trees it can be harder to interpret compared to simpler models like linear regression or decision trees.\nMemory Intensive: Storing multiple decision trees for large datasets require significant memory resources.\nOverfitting on Noisy Data: While Random Forest reduces overfitting, it can still overfit if the data is highly noisy especially with a large number of trees.\nSensitive to Imbalanced Data: It may perform poorly if the dataset is highly imbalanced like one class is significantly more frequent than another.\nRandom Forest Regression has become a important tool for continuous prediction tasks with advantages over traditional decision trees. Its capability to handle high-dimensional data, capture complex relationships and reduce overfitting has made it useful."
