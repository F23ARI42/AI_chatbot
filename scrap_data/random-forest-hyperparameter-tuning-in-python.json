Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the best set of parameters for a given model to maximize its efficiency and accuracy. We will explore two commonly used techniques for hyperparameter tuning:GridSearchCVandRandomizedSearchCV.\nBoth methods are essential for automating the process of fine-tuning machine learning models and we will examine how each works and when to use them. Below is the code with random forest working on heart disease prediction.\nOutput:\nThe classification report shows that the model has an accuracy of 84% with good precision for class 1 (0.90) but slightly lower precision for class 0 (0.77) and a recall of 0.87 for class 0. This suggests that fine-tuning hyperparameters such asn_estimatorsandmax_depthcould help improve the performance especially for class 0."
