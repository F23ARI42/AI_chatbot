Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\nStandard Deviation is defined as the degree ofdispersionof the data points from the mean value of the data points.\nStandard deviation is a measure used in statistics to understand how the data points in a set are spread out from the mean value.\nIt indicates the extent of the data's variation and shows how far individual data points deviate from the average."
