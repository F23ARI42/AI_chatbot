    "output": "We start by loading a popular groceries dataset. This dataset contains customer transactions with details like customer ID, transaction date, and the item purchased. you can download the dataset fromhere.\nOutput:\nEach row represents one item in a customer's basket on a given date.\nTo use the Apriori algorithm we must convert this into full transactions per customer per visit."

    "output": "Now we find rules likeIf bread and butter are bought, milk is also likely to be bought.\nSupport: How often the rule appears in the dataset.\nConfidence: Probability of buying item B if item A is bought.\nLift: Strength of the rule over random chance. (>1 means it's a good rule)\nOutput:"
