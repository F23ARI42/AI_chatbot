Memory:Agents typically have multiple types of memory:\nShort‑term memory for the current interaction\nLong‑term memory for storing historical data and conversations\nEpisodic memory for recalling specific past events\nConsensus memory for sharing knowledge among multiple agents\nMemory enables an agent to keep context, learn from experience and adapt its behaviour over time.\n3. Tools:These are functions or external resources the agent can use to access information, process data, control devices or connect with other systems. Tools may involve physical interfaces, graphical UIs or programmatic APIs. Agents also learn how and when to use these tools effectively, based on their capabilities and context.\n4. Model:Agents use large language model (LLM) which serves as the agent’s “brain”. The LLM interprets instructions, reasons about solutions, generates language and orchestrates other components including memory retrieval and tools to use to carry out tasks."

The data is transformed and abstracted at each layer.\nOutput Layer: After passing through all the layers, the network gives its final prediction like classifying an image as a cat or a dog.\nThe process ofbackpropagationis used to adjust the weights between neurons.

The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions."

    "input": "Example: Navigating a Maze",
    "output": "Consider a maze as our environment, where an agent's goal is to reach the trophy state (rewardR = 1) while avoiding the fire state (rewardR = -1). The agent receives positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and negative reinforcement for failing. The agent must navigate the maze efficiently while considering possible future rewards.\nWhat Happens Without the Bellman Equation?\nInitially we allow the agent to explore the environment and find a path to the goal. Once it reaches the trophy state it backtracks to its starting position and assigns a value of V = 1 to all states that lead to the goal.\nHowever if we change the agent’s starting position it will struggle to find a new path since all previously learned state values remain the same. This is where the Bellman Equation helps by dynamically updating state values based on future rewards.\nApplying the Concept\nConsider a state adjacent to the fire state, where V = 0.9. The agent can move UP, DOWN or RIGHT but cannot move LEFT due to a wall. Among the available actions the agent selects the action leading to the maximum value, ensuring the highest possible reward over time.\nBy continuously updating state values the agent systematically calculates the best path while avoiding the fire state. The goal (trophy) and failure (fire) states do not require value updates as they represent terminal states (V = 0). Bellman Equation allows agents to think ahead, balance immediate and future rewards and choose actions wisely."

Ask Yes/No Questions:From the root, the tree asks a series of yes/no questions to split the data into subsets based on specific attributes.\n3. Branching Based on Answers:Each question leads to different branches:\nIf the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.\nIf the answer is no, the tree follows another path.\n4. Continue Splitting:This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.\n5. Reach the Leaf Node:The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.\nLet’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:\n1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”\nIf yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.\nIf no, it says no coffee is needed.\n2.

The lower the Gini Impurity the better the feature splits the data into distinct categories.\nEntropy: This measures the amount of uncertainty or disorder in the data. The tree tries to reduce the entropy by splitting the data on features that provide the most information about the target variable.\nThese criteria help decide which features are useful for making the best split at each decision point in the tree."

It improves model performance by helping the tree generalize better to new data.

However they often face challenges in learning long-term dependencies where information from distant time steps becomes crucial for making accurate predictions for current state. This problem is known as the vanishing gradient or exploding gradient problem.\nVanishing Gradient: When training a model over time, the gradients which help the model learn can shrink as they pass through many steps. This makes it hard for the model to learn long-term patterns since earlier information becomes almost irrelevant.\nExploding Gradient: Sometimes gradients can grow too large causing instability. This makes it difficult for the model to learn properly as the updates to the model become erratic and unpredictable.\nBoth of these issues make it challenging for standard RNNs to effectively capture long-term dependencies in sequential data."
