Memory:Agents typically have multiple types of memory:\nShort‑term memory for the current interaction\nLong‑term memory for storing historical data and conversations\nEpisodic memory for recalling specific past events\nConsensus memory for sharing knowledge among multiple agents\nMemory enables an agent to keep context, learn from experience and adapt its behaviour over time.\n3. Tools:These are functions or external resources the agent can use to access information, process data, control devices or connect with other systems. Tools may involve physical interfaces, graphical UIs or programmatic APIs. Agents also learn how and when to use these tools effectively, based on their capabilities and context.\n4. Model:Agents use large language model (LLM) which serves as the agent’s “brain”.

The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions."

    "output": "Consider a maze as our environment, where an agent's goal is to reach the trophy state (rewardR = 1) while avoiding the fire state (rewardR = -1). The agent receives positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and negative reinforcement for failing. The agent must navigate the maze efficiently while considering possible future rewards.\nWhat Happens Without the Bellman Equation?\nInitially we allow the agent to explore the environment and find a path to the goal. Once it reaches the trophy state it backtracks to its starting position and assigns a value of V = 1 to all states that lead to the goal.\nHowever if we change the agent’s starting position it will struggle to find a new path since all previously learned state values remain the same. This is where the Bellman Equation helps by dynamically updating state values based on future rewards.\nApplying the Concept\nConsider a state adjacent to the fire state, where V = 0.9. The agent can move UP, DOWN or RIGHT but cannot move LEFT due to a wall. Among the available actions the agent selects the action leading to the maximum value, ensuring the highest possible reward over time.\nBy continuously updating state values the agent systematically calculates the best path while avoiding the fire state. The goal (trophy) and failure (fire) states do not require value updates as they represent terminal states (V = 0). Bellman Equation allows agents to think ahead, balance immediate and future rewards and choose actions wisely."

Branching Based on Answers:Each question leads to different branches:\nIf the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.\nIf the answer is no, the tree follows another path.\n4. Continue Splitting:This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.\n5. Reach the Leaf Node:The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.\nLet’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:\n1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”\nIf yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.\nIf no, it says no coffee is needed.\n2.

However they often face challenges in learning long-term dependencies where information from distant time steps becomes crucial for making accurate predictions for current state. This problem is known as the vanishing gradient or exploding gradient problem.\nVanishing Gradient: When training a model over time, the gradients which help the model learn can shrink as they pass through many steps. This makes it hard for the model to learn long-term patterns since earlier information becomes almost irrelevant.\nExploding Gradient: Sometimes gradients can grow too large causing instability.

Instead of just R, G, and B channels now we have more channels but lesser width and height. This operation is calledConvolution.

The possible size of filters can be axax3, where ‘a’ can be anything like 3, 5, or 7 but smaller as compared to the image dimension.\nDuring the forward pass, we slide each filter across the whole input volume step by step where each step is calledstride(which can have a value of 2, 3, or even 4 for high-dimensional images) and compute the dot product between the kernel weights and patch from input volume.\nAs we slide our filters we’ll get a 2-D output for each filter and we’ll stack them together as a result, we’ll get output volume having a depth equal to the number of filters.

In CNN, Generally, the input will be an image or a sequence of images. This layer holds the raw input of the image with width 32, height 32, and depth 3.\nConvolutional Layers:This is the layer, which is used to extract the feature from the input dataset. It applies a set of learnable filters known as the kernels to the input images. The filters/kernels are smaller matrices usually 2x2, 3x3, or 5x5 shape. it slides over the input image data and computes the dot product between kernel weight and the corresponding input image patch. The output of this layer is referred as feature maps. Suppose we use a total of 12 filters for this layer we’ll get an output volume of dimension 32 x 32 x 12.\nActivation Layer: By adding an activation function to the output of the preceding layer, activation layers add nonlinearity to the network. it will apply an element-wise activation function to the output of the convolution layer. Some common activation functions areRELU: max(0, x),Tanh,Leaky RELU, etc. The volume remains unchanged hence output volume will have dimensions 32 x 32 x 12.\nPooling layer: This layer is periodically inserted in the covnets and its main function is to reduce the size of volume which makes the computation fast reduces memory and also prevents overfitting. Two common types of pooling layers aremax poolingandaverage pooling. If we use a max pool with 2 x 2 filters and stride 2, the resultant volume will be of dimension 16x16x12.\n\nFlattening:The resulting feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector after the convolution and pooling layers so they can be passed into a completely linked layer for categorization or regression.\nFully Connected Layers:It takes the input from the previous layer and computes the final classification or regression task.\nOutput Layer:The output from the fully connected layers is then fed into a logistic function for classification tasks like sigmoid or softmax which converts the output of each class into the probability score of each class."

Each state can have one or more possible actions.\n3.Transition Model (T): The model tells us what happens when an action is taken in a state. It’s like asking: “If I move RIGHT from here, where will I land?” Sometimes the outcome isn’t always the same that’s uncertainty. For example:\n80% chance of moving in the intended direction\n10% chance of slipping to the left\n10% chance of slipping to the right\nThis randomness is called astochastic transition.\n4.Reward (R): A reward is a number given to the agent after it takes an action. If the reward is positive, it means the result of the action was good. If the reward is negative it means the outcome was bad or there was a penalty help the agent learn what’s good or bad. Examples:\n+1 for reaching the goal\n-1 for stepping into fire\n-0.1 for each step to encourage fewer moves\n5.Policy (π): A policy is the agent’s plan.

  {
    "input": "Step 4: Building a neural network",
    "output": "Next, we build the single-layer model using a Sequential architecture with one Dense layer. TheDense(1)indicates that this layer contains a single neuron. We apply the sigmoid activation function, which maps the output to a value between 0 and 1, suitable for binary classification. The original perceptron used a step function that only gave 0 or 1 as output and trained differently. But modern models use sigmoid because it’s smooth and helps the model learn better with gradient-based methods. Theinput_shape=(2,)specifies that each input sample consists of two features."

  {
    "input": "Step 5: Compile the Model",
    "output": "Next, we compile the model using the Adam optimizer, which is a popular and efficient algorithm for optimizing neural networks. We use binary cross-entropy as the loss function, which is well-suited for binary classification tasks with sigmoid activation. Additionally, we track the model’s performance using accuracy as the evaluation metric during training and testing."
  },
  {
    "input": "Step 6: Train the Model",
    "output": "Now, we train the model by iterating over the entire training dataset a specified number of times, called epochs. During training, the data is divided into smaller batches of samples, known as the batch size, which determines how many samples are processed before updating the model’s weights. We also set aside a fraction of the training data as validation data to monitor the model’s performance on unseen data during training."
  },
  {
    "input": "Step 7: Model Evaluation",
    "output": "After training we test the model's performance on unseen data.\nOutput:\nEven with such asimple modelwe achieved close to88% accuracy.That’s quite impressive for a neural network with just one layer. However for even better results we could addhidden layersor use more complex architectures likeCNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)."
