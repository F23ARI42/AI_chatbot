Memory:Agents typically have multiple types of memory:\nShort‑term memory for the current interaction\nLong‑term memory for storing historical data and conversations\nEpisodic memory for recalling specific past events\nConsensus memory for sharing knowledge among multiple agents\nMemory enables an agent to keep context, learn from experience and adapt its behaviour over time.\n3. Tools:These are functions or external resources the agent can use to access information, process data, control devices or connect with other systems. Tools may involve physical interfaces, graphical UIs or programmatic APIs. Agents also learn how and when to use these tools effectively, based on their capabilities and context.\n4. Model:Agents use large language model (LLM) which serves as the agent’s “brain”.

The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions."

    "output": "Consider a maze as our environment, where an agent's goal is to reach the trophy state (rewardR = 1) while avoiding the fire state (rewardR = -1). The agent receives positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and negative reinforcement for failing. The agent must navigate the maze efficiently while considering possible future rewards.\nWhat Happens Without the Bellman Equation?\nInitially we allow the agent to explore the environment and find a path to the goal. Once it reaches the trophy state it backtracks to its starting position and assigns a value of V = 1 to all states that lead to the goal.\nHowever if we change the agent’s starting position it will struggle to find a new path since all previously learned state values remain the same. This is where the Bellman Equation helps by dynamically updating state values based on future rewards.\nApplying the Concept\nConsider a state adjacent to the fire state, where V = 0.9. The agent can move UP, DOWN or RIGHT but cannot move LEFT due to a wall. Among the available actions the agent selects the action leading to the maximum value, ensuring the highest possible reward over time.\nBy continuously updating state values the agent systematically calculates the best path while avoiding the fire state. The goal (trophy) and failure (fire) states do not require value updates as they represent terminal states (V = 0). Bellman Equation allows agents to think ahead, balance immediate and future rewards and choose actions wisely."

Branching Based on Answers:Each question leads to different branches:\nIf the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.\nIf the answer is no, the tree follows another path.\n4. Continue Splitting:This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.\n5. Reach the Leaf Node:The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.\nLet’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:\n1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”\nIf yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.\nIf no, it says no coffee is needed.\n2.

However they often face challenges in learning long-term dependencies where information from distant time steps becomes crucial for making accurate predictions for current state.

This makes it hard for the model to learn long-term patterns since earlier information becomes almost irrelevant.\nExploding Gradient: Sometimes gradients can grow too large causing instability.

Instead of just R, G, and B channels now we have more channels but lesser width and height. This operation is calledConvolution.

The possible size of filters can be axax3, where ‘a’ can be anything like 3, 5, or 7 but smaller as compared to the image dimension.\nDuring the forward pass, we slide each filter across the whole input volume step by step where each step is calledstride(which can have a value of 2, 3, or even 4 for high-dimensional images) and compute the dot product between the kernel weights and patch from input volume.\nAs we slide our filters we’ll get a 2-D output for each filter and we’ll stack them together as a result, we’ll get output volume having a depth equal to the number of filters.

In CNN, Generally, the input will be an image or a sequence of images. This layer holds the raw input of the image with width 32, height 32, and depth 3.\nConvolutional Layers:This is the layer, which is used to extract the feature from the input dataset. It applies a set of learnable filters known as the kernels to the input images. The filters/kernels are smaller matrices usually 2x2, 3x3, or 5x5 shape. it slides over the input image data and computes the dot product between kernel weight and the corresponding input image patch. The output of this layer is referred as feature maps. Suppose we use a total of 12 filters for this layer we’ll get an output volume of dimension 32 x 32 x 12.\nActivation Layer: By adding an activation function to the output of the preceding layer, activation layers add nonlinearity to the network. it will apply an element-wise activation function to the output of the convolution layer. Some common activation functions areRELU: max(0, x),Tanh,Leaky RELU, etc. The volume remains unchanged hence output volume will have dimensions 32 x 32 x 12.\nPooling layer: This layer is periodically inserted in the covnets and its main function is to reduce the size of volume which makes the computation fast reduces memory and also prevents overfitting. Two common types of pooling layers aremax poolingandaverage pooling. If we use a max pool with 2 x 2 filters and stride 2, the resultant volume will be of dimension 16x16x12.\n\nFlattening:The resulting feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector after the convolution and pooling layers so they can be passed into a completely linked layer for categorization or regression.\nFully Connected Layers:It takes the input from the previous layer and computes the final classification or regression task.\nOutput Layer:The output from the fully connected layers is then fed into a logistic function for classification tasks like sigmoid or softmax which converts the output of each class into the probability score of each class."

Each state can have one or more possible actions.\n3.Transition Model (T): The model tells us what happens when an action is taken in a state. It’s like asking: “If I move RIGHT from here, where will I land?” Sometimes the outcome isn’t always the same that’s uncertainty. For example:\n80% chance of moving in the intended direction\n10% chance of slipping to the left\n10% chance of slipping to the right\nThis randomness is called astochastic transition.\n4.Reward (R): A reward is a number given to the agent after it takes an action. If the reward is positive, it means the result of the action was good. If the reward is negative it means the outcome was bad or there was a penalty help the agent learn what’s good or bad. Examples:\n+1 for reaching the goal\n-1 for stepping into fire\n-0.1 for each step to encourage fewer moves\n5.Policy (π): A policy is the agent’s plan. It tells the agent: “If you are in this state, take this action.” The goal is to find the best policy that helps the agent earn the highest total reward over time.\nLet’s consider a 3x4 grid world.

It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning.\nLogistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable.\nDecision Trees: Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome.\nRandom Forests: Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.\nSupport Vector Machine(SVM):The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.\nK-Nearest Neighbors:KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.\nGradient Boosting:Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like decision trees, to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones.\nNaive Bayes Algorithm:The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' Theorem with the “naive” assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label.\nLet's summarize the supervised machine learning algorithms in table:\nThese types of supervised learning in machine learning vary based on the problem we're trying to solve and the dataset we're working with.

This allows SVM to work efficiently with non-linear data by implicitly performing the mapping. For example consider data points that are not linearly separable. By applying a kernel function SVM transforms the data points into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable.\nLinear Kernel: For linear separability.\nPolynomial Kernel: Maps data into a polynomial space.\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Transforms data into a space based on distances between data points.\nIn this case the new variable y is created as a function of distance from the origin."

Modern machine learning algorithms rely heavily on SGD because, despite its simplicity, it may be quite effective when combined with regularization strategies and suitable learning rate schedules."

  {
    "input": "Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm",
    "output": "For machine learning model training, initializing model parameters (θ) and selecting a low learning rate (α) are the first steps in performing stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Next, to add unpredictability, the training data is jumbled at random. Every time around, the algorithm analyzes a single training sample and determines thecost function's gradient (J) in relation to the model's parameters. The size and direction of the steepest slope are represented by this gradient. The model is adjusted to minimize the cost function and provide predictions that are more accurate by updating θ in the gradient's opposite direction. The model can efficiently learn from and adjust to new information by going through these iterative processes for every data point.\nThe cost function,J(\\theta), is typically a function of the difference between the predicted valueh_{\\theta}(x)and the actual targety. In regression problems, it's often themean squared error; in classification problems, it can be cross-entropy loss, for example.\nFor Regression (Mean Squared Error):\nCost Function:\nJ(θ) =\\frac{1}{2m}* \\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{θ}(x^i) - y^i)^2\nGradient (Partial Derivatives):\n∇J(θ) = \\frac{1}{m}*\\sum_{i=1}^m(h_{\\theta}(x^i) - y^i)x_{j}^i for\\;\\;\\; j = 0 \\to n\nUpdate Parameters\nUpdate the model parameters (θ) based on the gradient and the learning rate:\n\\theta = \\theta -\\alpha * \\nabla J(\\theta)\nwhere,\nθ: Updated model parameters.\nα: Learning rate.\n∇J(θ): Gradient vector computed."

  },
  {
    "input": "How it Differs from Other Classifiers:",
    "output": "The SGD Classifier differs from other classifiers in several ways:\nStochastic Gradient Descent:Unlike some classifiers that use closed-form solutions orbatch gradient descent(which processes the entire training dataset in each iteration), the SGD Classifier uses stochastic gradient descent. It updates the model's parameters incrementally, processing one training example at a time or in small mini-batches. This makes it computationally efficient and well-suited for large datasets.\nLinearity:The SGD Classifier is a linear classifier, meaning it constructs a linear decision boundary to separate classes. This makes it suitable for problems where the relationship between features and the target variable is approximately linear. In contrast, algorithms like decision trees or support vector machines can capture more complex decision boundaries.\nRegularization:The SGD Classifier allows for the incorporation ofL1 or L2 regularizationto prevent overfitting. Regularization terms are added to the cost function, encouraging the model to have smaller parameter values. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data."

    "input": "Parameters of Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier",
    "output": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier is a versatile algorithm with various parameters and concepts that can significantly impact its performance. Here's a detailed explanation of some of the key parameters and concepts relevant to the SGD Classifier:\n1. Learning Rate (α):\nThelearning rate(α) is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken during parameter updates in each iteration.\nIt controls the trade-off between convergence speed and stability.\nA larger learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may result in overshooting the optimal solution.\nIn contrast, a smaller learning rate may lead to slower convergence but with more stable updates.\nIt's important to choose an appropriate learning rate for your specific problem.\n2. Batch Size:\nThe batch size defines the number of training examples used in each iteration or mini-batch when updating the model parameters. There are three common choices for batch size:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (batch size = 1):In this case, the model parameters are updated after processing each training example. This introduces significant randomness and can help escape local minima but may result in noisy updates.\nMini-Batch Gradient Descent (1 < batch size < number of training examples):Mini-batch SGDstrikes a balance between the efficiency of batch gradient descent and the noise of stochastic gradient descent. It's the most commonly used variant.\nBatch Gradient Descent (batch size = number of training examples):In this case, the model parameters are updated using the entire training dataset in each iteration. While this can lead to more stable updates, it is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n3. Convergence Criteria:\nConvergence criteria are used to determine when the optimization process should stop. Common convergence criteria include:\nFixed Number of Epochs:You can set a predefined number of epochs, and the algorithm stops after completing that many iterations through the dataset.\nTolerance on the Change in the Cost Function:Stop when the change in the cost function between consecutive iterations becomes smaller than a specified threshold.\nValidation Set Performance:You can monitor the performance of the model on a separate validation set and stop training when it reaches a satisfactory level of performance.\n4. Regularization (L1 and L2):\nRegularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting.\nThe SGD Classifier allows you to incorporate L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms into the cost function.\nThese terms add a penalty based on the magnitude of the model parameters, encouraging them to be small.\nThe regularization strength hyperparameter controls the impact of regularization on the optimization process.\n5. Loss Function:\nThe choice of theloss functiondetermines how the classifier measures the error between predicted and actual class labels.\nFor binary classification, the cross-entropy loss is commonly used, while for multi-class problems, the categorical cross-entropy or softmax loss is typical.\nThe choice of the loss function should align with the problem and the activation function used.\n6. Momentum and Adaptive Learning Rates:\nTo enhance convergence and avoid oscillations, you can use momentum techniques or adaptive learning rates. Momentum introduces an additional parameter that smoothers the updates and helps the algorithm escape local minima.Adaptive learning ratemethods automatically adjust the learning rate during training based on the observed progress.\n7. Early Stopping:\nEarly stoppingis a technique used to prevent overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the optimization process when the performance starts to degrade, indicating overfitting."

The data is then split 70–30 for training and testing purposes, with a reproducible random seed of 42. This yields training and testing sets for both features and labels.\nAn SGD Classifier (clf) is instantiated for classification tasks in this code. Because the classifier is configured to use the log loss (logistic loss) function, it can be used for both binary and multiclass classification. Furthermore, to help avoid overfitting, L2 regularization is used with an alpha parameter of 0.01. To guarantee consistency of results, a random seed of 42 is chosen, and the classifier is programmed to run up to 1000 iterations during training.\nUsing the training data (X_train and y_train), these lines of code train the SGD Classifier (clf). Following training, the model is applied to generate predictions on the test data (X_test), which are then saved in the y_pred variable for a future analysis.\nOutput:\nThese lines of code compare the predicted labels (y_pred) with the actual labels of the test data (y_test) to determine the classification accuracy. To assess the performance of the model, theaccuracyscore is displayed on the console.\nOutput:\n\n\nWith the help of the Seaborn library, these lines of code visualize theconfusion matrixas a heatmap. The counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions are all included in the conf_matrix. The values are labeled on the heatmap, and the target class names are set for the x and y labels. At last, the plot gets a title, which is then shown. Understanding the model's performance in each class is made easier with the help of this representation.\nOutput:\n\n\nFor the two classes Setosa and Versicolor in the Iris dataset, this code generates ascatter plotto show the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width. Plotting the data points for each class with unique markers (circles for Setosa and crosses for Versicolor) is done using the plt.scatter function. To enhance the plot's visual appeal and informativeness, x and y-axis labels, a legend, and a title are added.\nOutput:\nUsing the classification_report function, this code generates theclassification reportfor the actual labels (y_test) and the predicted results (y_pred), which includes multiple classification metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

This makes it suitable for scenarios with massive amounts of data.\nOnline Learning:SGD is well-suited for online learning, where the model can adapt and learn from incoming data streams in real-time. It can continuously update its parameters, making it useful for applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, and clickstream analysis.\nQuick Convergence:SGD often converges faster than batch gradient descent because of the more frequent parameter updates. This speed can be beneficial when you have computational constraints or want to quickly iterate through different model configurations.\nRegularization Support:The SGD Classifier allows for the incorporation of L1 and L2 regularization terms, which help prevent overfitting.

If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm may overshoot the optimal solution, while too low of a learning rate can lead to slow convergence. Finding the right balance can be time-consuming.\nSensitivity to Feature Scaling:SGD is sensitive to feature scaling. Features should ideally be standardized (i.e., mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) to ensure optimal convergence. Failure to do so can lead to convergence issues.\nLimited Modeling Capabilities:Being a linear classifier, the SGD Classifier may struggle with complex data that doesn't have a linear decision boundary. In such cases, other algorithms like decision trees or neural networks might be more suitable."

A linear model often results in residuals with noticeable patterns which shows a poor fit. It can capture these non-linear patterns effectively.\nFlexibility and Complexity:It does not assume all independent variables are independent. By introducing higher-degree terms, it allows for more flexibility and can model more complex, curvilinear relationships between variables."

In simple linear regression, this relationship is modeled as:\ny = a + bx + e\nHere\nyis a dependent variable\nais the y-intercept,bis the slope\neis the error term\nHowever in cases where the relationship between the variables is nonlinear such as modelling chemical synthesis based on temperature, a linear model may not be sufficient. Instead, we use polynomial regression which introduces higher-degree terms such asx ^2to better capture the relationship.\nFor example, a quadratic model can be written as:\ny = a + b_1x + b_2x^2 + e\nHere:\nyis the dependent variable onx\nais the y-intercept andeis the error rate.\nIn general, polynomial regression can be extended to the nth degree:\ny = a + b_1x + b_2x^2 +....+ b_nx^n\nWhile the regression function is linear in terms of the unknown coefficients𝑏_0,𝑏_1,…,𝑏_𝑛, the model itself captures non-linear patterns in the data. The coefficients are estimated using techniques like Least Square technique to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.\nChoosing the right polynomial degreenis important: a higher degree may fit the data more closely but it can lead to overfitting. The degree should be selected based on the complexity of the data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data, capturing non-linear relationships and providing a more accurate model for real-world applications."

    "input": "How Ridge RegressionAddresses Overfitting and Multicollinearity?",
    "output": "Overfittingoccurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data. Ridge regression combats overfitting by adding a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function.\nThis penalty discourages the model from using large values for the coefficients (the numbers multiplying the features). It forces the model to keep these coefficients small.  By making the coefficients smaller and closer to zero, ridge regression simplifies the model and reduces its sensitivity to random fluctuations or noise in the data. This makes the model less likely to overfit and helps it perform better on new, unseen data, improving its overall accuracy and reliability.\nFor Example- We are predicting house prices based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and age of the house:\nPrice=1000 Size−500⋅Age+Noise\nRidge might adjust it to:\nPrice=800⋅Size−300⋅Age+Less Noise\nAs lambda increases the modelplaces more emphasis on shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated features, making their impact smaller and more stable. This reduces the effect of multicollinearity by preventing large fluctuations in coefficient estimates due to correlated predictors."

The ridge regression estimator is:\n\\hat{\\beta}_k = (X'X + kI)^{-1}X'y\nThis modification stabilizes the estimates by shrinking the coefficients, improving generalization and mitigating multicollinearity effects."

The following simulation illustrates how the variation in β is affected by different penalty values, showing how estimated parameters deviate from the true values.\nRidge regression introduces bias into the estimates to reduce their variance. Themean squared error (MSE)of the ridge estimator can be decomposed into bias and variance components:\n\\text{MSE}(\\hat{\\beta}_k) = \\text{Bias}^2(\\hat{\\beta}_k) + \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_k)\nBias: Measures the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. In ridge regression, as the regularization parameter k increases, the model becomes simpler, which increases bias but reduces variance.\nVariance: Measures how much the ridge regression model's predictions would vary if we used different training data. As the regularization parameter k decreases, the model becomes more complex, fitting the training data more closely, which reduces bias but increases variance.\nIrreducible Error: Represents the noise in the data that cannot be reduced by any model.\nAs k increases, the bias increases, but the variance decreases.

This analysis does not take into account third-party influence.For example,the correlation between the yield per acre of grain and jute can be of a high degree because both are linked to the amount of rainfall. However, in reality, both these variables do not have any effect on each other.\nIt may be challenging to determine which is the cause, and which is the effect when two variables indicate a high degree of correlation. It is so because they may be having an impact on one another.For example,when there is an increase in the price of a commodity, it increases its demand. Here, the price is the cause, and demand is the effect. However, there is a possibility that the price of the commodity will rise due to increased demand (population growth or other factors). In that case, increased demand is the cause, and the price is the effect.\nIt is possible that the correlation between the two variables was obtained by random chance or coincidence alone. This correlation is also known asspurious. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether there is a possibility of a relationship between the variables under analysis.For example,even if there is no relationship between the two variables (between the income of people in a society and their clothes size), one may see a strong correlation between them.\nSo, it can be said that correlation provides only a quantitative measure and does not indicates cause and effect relationship between the variables.

In this case, each epoch would consist of 10 iterations with each iteration processing one batch of 100 samples.\nTypically, when training a model, the number of epochs is set to a large number like 100 and anearly stoppingmethod is used to determine when to stop training.

This approach ensures that the model is not exposed to any information from the validation set during training, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cross-validation process.\nThe necessity to fit the encoder on the training folds and not on the validation fold in each cross-validation step is to prevent overfitting and data leakage.\nIf the encoder is fit on the entire dataset, including the validation set, it can lead to the model being biased towards the validation set, resulting in overfitting.\nNested cross-validation is a robust technique to mitigate data leakage and ensure unbiased model evaluation.

    "output": "Implementing target encoding within nested cross-validation demands careful attention to various considerations and adherence to best practices. Common pitfalls and offer guidance on best practices for maximizing the effectiveness of this technique:\nChoosing Appropriate Encoding Techniques: Different categorical variables may require different encoding techniques. For ordinal variables, methods like ordinal encoding might be suitable, while for nominal variables, techniques like target encoding or one-hot encoding could be considered. Understanding the nature of the categorical variables in your dataset is crucial for selecting the most appropriate encoding method.\nHandling Missing Values During Encoding: Missing values within categorical variables pose a challenge during encoding. It's essential to decide how to handle these missing values before applying target encoding. Options include treating missing values as a separate category, imputing them with the mode or median, or using advanced imputation techniques. The chosen approach should align with the specific characteristics of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis.\nDealing with Rare or Unseen Categories: In real-world datasets, categorical variables may contain rare or unseen categories that were not present in the training data. Target encoding such categories based solely on the training set may lead to biased or unreliable results. To address this issue, consider techniques such as frequency thresholding or combining rare categories into a single group. Additionally, incorporating domain knowledge or external data sources can aid in properly handling rare categories during encoding.\nPreventing Overfitting and Data Leakage: Overfitting and data leakage are significant concerns when using target encoding within nested cross-validation. To mitigate these risks, ensure that the encoding is performed solely on the training folds during cross-validation. This prevents information from the validation set from influencing the encoding process, leading to more reliable model evaluation. By adhering to this practice, the model can generalize better to unseen data and provide more accurate performance estimates."

Overfitting happens when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data, usually due to the model being too complex. This results in low training error but higher test error.\nTo prevent overfitting, regularization techniques are used to help the model focus on learning meaningful patterns instead of memorizing the training data.Early stoppingis one such technique that stops training once the model shows signs of overfitting and ensures it generalizes better to new data."

It prevents the model from performing well on the training set but underperforming on unseen data i.e validation set. Training stops when performance improves on the training set but degrades on the validation set, promoting better generalization while saving time and resources.\nThe technique monitors the model’s performance on both the training and validation sets. If the validation performance worsens, training stops and the model retains the best weights from the period of optimal validation performance.\n\nEarly stopping is an efficient method when training data is limited as it typically requires fewer epochs than other techniques.

This allows the model to learn more complex data patterns and model intricate relationships between features.\nSparse Activation:ReLU's ability to output zero for negative inputs introduces sparsity in the network, meaning that only a fraction of neurons activate at any given time. This can lead to more efficient and faster computation.\nGradient Computation:ReLU offers computational advantages in terms of backpropagation, as its derivative is simple—either 0 (when the input is negative) or 1 (when the input is positive).

How well this line captures the trend in the data depends on the complexity of the model you use.\nWhen a model is too simple, like fitting a straight line to curved data, it hashigh biasand fails to capture the true relationship, leading tounderfitting. For example, a linear model cannot represent a non-linear increase in house prices with size.\nHowever, if the model becomes too complex, like a fourth-degree polynomial that adjusts to every point, it developshigh variance, overfits the training data, and struggles to generalize to new data. This isoverfitting, where the model performs well on training but poorly on testing.\nAn ideal model strikes a balance withlow bias and low variance, capturing the overall pattern without overreacting to noise.

This means the presence of one word doesn't affect the presence of another word which makes the model easy to use.\nThe model looks at how many times each word appears in messages from different categories (like \"spam\" or \"not spam\"). For example if the word \"free\" appears often in spam messages that will be used to help predict whether a new message is spam or not.\nTo calculate the probability of a message belonging to a certain category Multinomial Naive Bayes uses themultinomial distribution:\nWhere:\nn is the total number of trials.\nn_iis the count of occurrences for outcome i.\np_iis the probability of outcome i.\nTo estimate how likely each word is in a particular class like \"spam\" or \"not spam\" we use a method calledMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).This helps finding probabilities based on actual counts from our data.
