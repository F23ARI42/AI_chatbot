Memory:Agents typically have multiple types of memory:\nShort‑term memory for the current interaction\nLong‑term memory for storing historical data and conversations\nEpisodic memory for recalling specific past events\nConsensus memory for sharing knowledge among multiple agents\nMemory enables an agent to keep context, learn from experience and adapt its behaviour over time.\n3. Tools:These are functions or external resources the agent can use to access information, process data, control devices or connect with other systems. Tools may involve physical interfaces, graphical UIs or programmatic APIs. Agents also learn how and when to use these tools effectively, based on their capabilities and context.\n4. Model:Agents use large language model (LLM) which serves as the agent’s “brain”.

The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions."

    "output": "Consider a maze as our environment, where an agent's goal is to reach the trophy state (rewardR = 1) while avoiding the fire state (rewardR = -1). The agent receives positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and negative reinforcement for failing. The agent must navigate the maze efficiently while considering possible future rewards.\nWhat Happens Without the Bellman Equation?\nInitially we allow the agent to explore the environment and find a path to the goal. Once it reaches the trophy state it backtracks to its starting position and assigns a value of V = 1 to all states that lead to the goal.\nHowever if we change the agent’s starting position it will struggle to find a new path since all previously learned state values remain the same. This is where the Bellman Equation helps by dynamically updating state values based on future rewards.\nApplying the Concept\nConsider a state adjacent to the fire state, where V = 0.9. The agent can move UP, DOWN or RIGHT but cannot move LEFT due to a wall. Among the available actions the agent selects the action leading to the maximum value, ensuring the highest possible reward over time.\nBy continuously updating state values the agent systematically calculates the best path while avoiding the fire state. The goal (trophy) and failure (fire) states do not require value updates as they represent terminal states (V = 0). Bellman Equation allows agents to think ahead, balance immediate and future rewards and choose actions wisely."

Branching Based on Answers:Each question leads to different branches:\nIf the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.\nIf the answer is no, the tree follows another path.\n4. Continue Splitting:This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.\n5. Reach the Leaf Node:The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.\nLet’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:\n1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”\nIf yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.\nIf no, it says no coffee is needed.\n2.

However they often face challenges in learning long-term dependencies where information from distant time steps becomes crucial for making accurate predictions for current state.

This makes it hard for the model to learn long-term patterns since earlier information becomes almost irrelevant.\nExploding Gradient: Sometimes gradients can grow too large causing instability.

Instead of just R, G, and B channels now we have more channels but lesser width and height. This operation is calledConvolution.

The possible size of filters can be axax3, where ‘a’ can be anything like 3, 5, or 7 but smaller as compared to the image dimension.\nDuring the forward pass, we slide each filter across the whole input volume step by step where each step is calledstride(which can have a value of 2, 3, or even 4 for high-dimensional images) and compute the dot product between the kernel weights and patch from input volume.\nAs we slide our filters we’ll get a 2-D output for each filter and we’ll stack them together as a result, we’ll get output volume having a depth equal to the number of filters.

In CNN, Generally, the input will be an image or a sequence of images. This layer holds the raw input of the image with width 32, height 32, and depth 3.\nConvolutional Layers:This is the layer, which is used to extract the feature from the input dataset. It applies a set of learnable filters known as the kernels to the input images. The filters/kernels are smaller matrices usually 2x2, 3x3, or 5x5 shape. it slides over the input image data and computes the dot product between kernel weight and the corresponding input image patch. The output of this layer is referred as feature maps. Suppose we use a total of 12 filters for this layer we’ll get an output volume of dimension 32 x 32 x 12.\nActivation Layer: By adding an activation function to the output of the preceding layer, activation layers add nonlinearity to the network. it will apply an element-wise activation function to the output of the convolution layer. Some common activation functions areRELU: max(0, x),Tanh,Leaky RELU, etc. The volume remains unchanged hence output volume will have dimensions 32 x 32 x 12.\nPooling layer: This layer is periodically inserted in the covnets and its main function is to reduce the size of volume which makes the computation fast reduces memory and also prevents overfitting. Two common types of pooling layers aremax poolingandaverage pooling. If we use a max pool with 2 x 2 filters and stride 2, the resultant volume will be of dimension 16x16x12.\n\nFlattening:The resulting feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector after the convolution and pooling layers so they can be passed into a completely linked layer for categorization or regression.\nFully Connected Layers:It takes the input from the previous layer and computes the final classification or regression task.\nOutput Layer:The output from the fully connected layers is then fed into a logistic function for classification tasks like sigmoid or softmax which converts the output of each class into the probability score of each class."

Each state can have one or more possible actions.\n3.Transition Model (T): The model tells us what happens when an action is taken in a state. It’s like asking: “If I move RIGHT from here, where will I land?” Sometimes the outcome isn’t always the same that’s uncertainty. For example:\n80% chance of moving in the intended direction\n10% chance of slipping to the left\n10% chance of slipping to the right\nThis randomness is called astochastic transition.\n4.Reward (R): A reward is a number given to the agent after it takes an action. If the reward is positive, it means the result of the action was good. If the reward is negative it means the outcome was bad or there was a penalty help the agent learn what’s good or bad. Examples:\n+1 for reaching the goal\n-1 for stepping into fire\n-0.1 for each step to encourage fewer moves\n5.Policy (π): A policy is the agent’s plan. It tells the agent: “If you are in this state, take this action.” The goal is to find the best policy that helps the agent earn the highest total reward over time.\nLet’s consider a 3x4 grid world.

It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning.\nLogistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable.\nDecision Trees: Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome.\nRandom Forests: Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.\nSupport Vector Machine(SVM):The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.\nK-Nearest Neighbors:KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.\nGradient Boosting:Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like decision trees, to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones.\nNaive Bayes Algorithm:The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' Theorem with the “naive” assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label.\nLet's summarize the supervised machine learning algorithms in table:\nThese types of supervised learning in machine learning vary based on the problem we're trying to solve and the dataset we're working with.

This allows SVM to work efficiently with non-linear data by implicitly performing the mapping. For example consider data points that are not linearly separable. By applying a kernel function SVM transforms the data points into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable.\nLinear Kernel: For linear separability.\nPolynomial Kernel: Maps data into a polynomial space.\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Transforms data into a space based on distances between data points.\nIn this case the new variable y is created as a function of distance from the origin."

Modern machine learning algorithms rely heavily on SGD because, despite its simplicity, it may be quite effective when combined with regularization strategies and suitable learning rate schedules."

  {
    "input": "Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm",
    "output": "For machine learning model training, initializing model parameters (θ) and selecting a low learning rate (α) are the first steps in performing stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Next, to add unpredictability, the training data is jumbled at random. Every time around, the algorithm analyzes a single training sample and determines thecost function's gradient (J) in relation to the model's parameters. The size and direction of the steepest slope are represented by this gradient. The model is adjusted to minimize the cost function and provide predictions that are more accurate by updating θ in the gradient's opposite direction. The model can efficiently learn from and adjust to new information by going through these iterative processes for every data point.\nThe cost function,J(\\theta), is typically a function of the difference between the predicted valueh_{\\theta}(x)and the actual targety. In regression problems, it's often themean squared error; in classification problems, it can be cross-entropy loss, for example.\nFor Regression (Mean Squared Error):\nCost Function:\nJ(θ) =\\frac{1}{2m}* \\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{θ}(x^i) - y^i)^2\nGradient (Partial Derivatives):\n∇J(θ) = \\frac{1}{m}*\\sum_{i=1}^m(h_{\\theta}(x^i) - y^i)x_{j}^i for\\;\\;\\; j = 0 \\to n\nUpdate Parameters\nUpdate the model parameters (θ) based on the gradient and the learning rate:\n\\theta = \\theta -\\alpha * \\nabla J(\\theta)\nwhere,\nθ: Updated model parameters.\nα: Learning rate.\n∇J(θ): Gradient vector computed."

  },
  {
    "input": "How it Differs from Other Classifiers:",
    "output": "The SGD Classifier differs from other classifiers in several ways:\nStochastic Gradient Descent:Unlike some classifiers that use closed-form solutions orbatch gradient descent(which processes the entire training dataset in each iteration), the SGD Classifier uses stochastic gradient descent. It updates the model's parameters incrementally, processing one training example at a time or in small mini-batches. This makes it computationally efficient and well-suited for large datasets.\nLinearity:The SGD Classifier is a linear classifier, meaning it constructs a linear decision boundary to separate classes. This makes it suitable for problems where the relationship between features and the target variable is approximately linear. In contrast, algorithms like decision trees or support vector machines can capture more complex decision boundaries.\nRegularization:The SGD Classifier allows for the incorporation ofL1 or L2 regularizationto prevent overfitting. Regularization terms are added to the cost function, encouraging the model to have smaller parameter values. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data."

    "input": "Parameters of Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier",
    "output": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier is a versatile algorithm with various parameters and concepts that can significantly impact its performance. Here's a detailed explanation of some of the key parameters and concepts relevant to the SGD Classifier:\n1. Learning Rate (α):\nThelearning rate(α) is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken during parameter updates in each iteration.\nIt controls the trade-off between convergence speed and stability.\nA larger learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may result in overshooting the optimal solution.\nIn contrast, a smaller learning rate may lead to slower convergence but with more stable updates.\nIt's important to choose an appropriate learning rate for your specific problem.\n2. Batch Size:\nThe batch size defines the number of training examples used in each iteration or mini-batch when updating the model parameters. There are three common choices for batch size:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (batch size = 1):In this case, the model parameters are updated after processing each training example. This introduces significant randomness and can help escape local minima but may result in noisy updates.\nMini-Batch Gradient Descent (1 < batch size < number of training examples):Mini-batch SGDstrikes a balance between the efficiency of batch gradient descent and the noise of stochastic gradient descent. It's the most commonly used variant.\nBatch Gradient Descent (batch size = number of training examples):In this case, the model parameters are updated using the entire training dataset in each iteration. While this can lead to more stable updates, it is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n3. Convergence Criteria:\nConvergence criteria are used to determine when the optimization process should stop. Common convergence criteria include:\nFixed Number of Epochs:You can set a predefined number of epochs, and the algorithm stops after completing that many iterations through the dataset.\nTolerance on the Change in the Cost Function:Stop when the change in the cost function between consecutive iterations becomes smaller than a specified threshold.\nValidation Set Performance:You can monitor the performance of the model on a separate validation set and stop training when it reaches a satisfactory level of performance.\n4. Regularization (L1 and L2):\nRegularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting.\nThe SGD Classifier allows you to incorporate L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms into the cost function.\nThese terms add a penalty based on the magnitude of the model parameters, encouraging them to be small.\nThe regularization strength hyperparameter controls the impact of regularization on the optimization process.\n5. Loss Function:\nThe choice of theloss functiondetermines how the classifier measures the error between predicted and actual class labels.\nFor binary classification, the cross-entropy loss is commonly used, while for multi-class problems, the categorical cross-entropy or softmax loss is typical.\nThe choice of the loss function should align with the problem and the activation function used.\n6. Momentum and Adaptive Learning Rates:\nTo enhance convergence and avoid oscillations, you can use momentum techniques or adaptive learning rates. Momentum introduces an additional parameter that smoothers the updates and helps the algorithm escape local minima.Adaptive learning ratemethods automatically adjust the learning rate during training based on the observed progress.\n7. Early Stopping:\nEarly stoppingis a technique used to prevent overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the optimization process when the performance starts to degrade, indicating overfitting."

The data is then split 70–30 for training and testing purposes, with a reproducible random seed of 42. This yields training and testing sets for both features and labels.\nAn SGD Classifier (clf) is instantiated for classification tasks in this code. Because the classifier is configured to use the log loss (logistic loss) function, it can be used for both binary and multiclass classification. Furthermore, to help avoid overfitting, L2 regularization is used with an alpha parameter of 0.01. To guarantee consistency of results, a random seed of 42 is chosen, and the classifier is programmed to run up to 1000 iterations during training.\nUsing the training data (X_train and y_train), these lines of code train the SGD Classifier (clf). Following training, the model is applied to generate predictions on the test data (X_test), which are then saved in the y_pred variable for a future analysis.\nOutput:\nThese lines of code compare the predicted labels (y_pred) with the actual labels of the test data (y_test) to determine the classification accuracy. To assess the performance of the model, theaccuracyscore is displayed on the console.\nOutput:\n\n\nWith the help of the Seaborn library, these lines of code visualize theconfusion matrixas a heatmap. The counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions are all included in the conf_matrix. The values are labeled on the heatmap, and the target class names are set for the x and y labels. At last, the plot gets a title, which is then shown. Understanding the model's performance in each class is made easier with the help of this representation.\nOutput:\n\n\nFor the two classes Setosa and Versicolor in the Iris dataset, this code generates ascatter plotto show the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width. Plotting the data points for each class with unique markers (circles for Setosa and crosses for Versicolor) is done using the plt.scatter function. To enhance the plot's visual appeal and informativeness, x and y-axis labels, a legend, and a title are added.\nOutput:\nUsing the classification_report function, this code generates theclassification reportfor the actual labels (y_test) and the predicted results (y_pred), which includes multiple classification metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

This makes it suitable for scenarios with massive amounts of data.\nOnline Learning:SGD is well-suited for online learning, where the model can adapt and learn from incoming data streams in real-time. It can continuously update its parameters, making it useful for applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, and clickstream analysis.\nQuick Convergence:SGD often converges faster than batch gradient descent because of the more frequent parameter updates. This speed can be beneficial when you have computational constraints or want to quickly iterate through different model configurations.\nRegularization Support:The SGD Classifier allows for the incorporation of L1 and L2 regularization terms, which help prevent overfitting.

If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm may overshoot the optimal solution, while too low of a learning rate can lead to slow convergence. Finding the right balance can be time-consuming.\nSensitivity to Feature Scaling:SGD is sensitive to feature scaling. Features should ideally be standardized (i.e., mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) to ensure optimal convergence. Failure to do so can lead to convergence issues.\nLimited Modeling Capabilities:Being a linear classifier, the SGD Classifier may struggle with complex data that doesn't have a linear decision boundary. In such cases, other algorithms like decision trees or neural networks might be more suitable."

A linear model often results in residuals with noticeable patterns which shows a poor fit. It can capture these non-linear patterns effectively.\nFlexibility and Complexity:It does not assume all independent variables are independent. By introducing higher-degree terms, it allows for more flexibility and can model more complex, curvilinear relationships between variables."

In simple linear regression, this relationship is modeled as:\ny = a + bx + e\nHere\nyis a dependent variable\nais the y-intercept,bis the slope\neis the error term\nHowever in cases where the relationship between the variables is nonlinear such as modelling chemical synthesis based on temperature, a linear model may not be sufficient. Instead, we use polynomial regression which introduces higher-degree terms such asx ^2to better capture the relationship.\nFor example, a quadratic model can be written as:\ny = a + b_1x + b_2x^2 + e\nHere:\nyis the dependent variable onx\nais the y-intercept andeis the error rate.\nIn general, polynomial regression can be extended to the nth degree:\ny = a + b_1x + b_2x^2 +....+ b_nx^n\nWhile the regression function is linear in terms of the unknown coefficients𝑏_0,𝑏_1,…,𝑏_𝑛, the model itself captures non-linear patterns in the data. The coefficients are estimated using techniques like Least Square technique to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.\nChoosing the right polynomial degreenis important: a higher degree may fit the data more closely but it can lead to overfitting. The degree should be selected based on the complexity of the data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data, capturing non-linear relationships and providing a more accurate model for real-world applications."

    "input": "How Ridge RegressionAddresses Overfitting and Multicollinearity?",
    "output": "Overfittingoccurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data. Ridge regression combats overfitting by adding a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function.\nThis penalty discourages the model from using large values for the coefficients (the numbers multiplying the features). It forces the model to keep these coefficients small.  By making the coefficients smaller and closer to zero, ridge regression simplifies the model and reduces its sensitivity to random fluctuations or noise in the data. This makes the model less likely to overfit and helps it perform better on new, unseen data, improving its overall accuracy and reliability.\nFor Example- We are predicting house prices based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and age of the house:\nPrice=1000 Size−500⋅Age+Noise\nRidge might adjust it to:\nPrice=800⋅Size−300⋅Age+Less Noise\nAs lambda increases the modelplaces more emphasis on shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated features, making their impact smaller and more stable. This reduces the effect of multicollinearity by preventing large fluctuations in coefficient estimates due to correlated predictors."

The ridge regression estimator is:\n\\hat{\\beta}_k = (X'X + kI)^{-1}X'y\nThis modification stabilizes the estimates by shrinking the coefficients, improving generalization and mitigating multicollinearity effects."

The following simulation illustrates how the variation in β is affected by different penalty values, showing how estimated parameters deviate from the true values.\nRidge regression introduces bias into the estimates to reduce their variance. Themean squared error (MSE)of the ridge estimator can be decomposed into bias and variance components:\n\\text{MSE}(\\hat{\\beta}_k) = \\text{Bias}^2(\\hat{\\beta}_k) + \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_k)\nBias: Measures the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. In ridge regression, as the regularization parameter k increases, the model becomes simpler, which increases bias but reduces variance.\nVariance: Measures how much the ridge regression model's predictions would vary if we used different training data. As the regularization parameter k decreases, the model becomes more complex, fitting the training data more closely, which reduces bias but increases variance.\nIrreducible Error: Represents the noise in the data that cannot be reduced by any model.\nAs k increases, the bias increases, but the variance decreases.

This analysis does not take into account third-party influence.For example,the correlation between the yield per acre of grain and jute can be of a high degree because both are linked to the amount of rainfall. However, in reality, both these variables do not have any effect on each other.\nIt may be challenging to determine which is the cause, and which is the effect when two variables indicate a high degree of correlation. It is so because they may be having an impact on one another.For example,when there is an increase in the price of a commodity, it increases its demand. Here, the price is the cause, and demand is the effect. However, there is a possibility that the price of the commodity will rise due to increased demand (population growth or other factors). In that case, increased demand is the cause, and the price is the effect.\nIt is possible that the correlation between the two variables was obtained by random chance or coincidence alone. This correlation is also known asspurious. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether there is a possibility of a relationship between the variables under analysis.For example,even if there is no relationship between the two variables (between the income of people in a society and their clothes size), one may see a strong correlation between them.\nSo, it can be said that correlation provides only a quantitative measure and does not indicates cause and effect relationship between the variables.

In this case, each epoch would consist of 10 iterations with each iteration processing one batch of 100 samples.\nTypically, when training a model, the number of epochs is set to a large number like 100 and anearly stoppingmethod is used to determine when to stop training.

This approach ensures that the model is not exposed to any information from the validation set during training, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cross-validation process.\nThe necessity to fit the encoder on the training folds and not on the validation fold in each cross-validation step is to prevent overfitting and data leakage.\nIf the encoder is fit on the entire dataset, including the validation set, it can lead to the model being biased towards the validation set, resulting in overfitting.\nNested cross-validation is a robust technique to mitigate data leakage and ensure unbiased model evaluation.

    "output": "Implementing target encoding within nested cross-validation demands careful attention to various considerations and adherence to best practices. Common pitfalls and offer guidance on best practices for maximizing the effectiveness of this technique:\nChoosing Appropriate Encoding Techniques: Different categorical variables may require different encoding techniques. For ordinal variables, methods like ordinal encoding might be suitable, while for nominal variables, techniques like target encoding or one-hot encoding could be considered. Understanding the nature of the categorical variables in your dataset is crucial for selecting the most appropriate encoding method.\nHandling Missing Values During Encoding: Missing values within categorical variables pose a challenge during encoding. It's essential to decide how to handle these missing values before applying target encoding. Options include treating missing values as a separate category, imputing them with the mode or median, or using advanced imputation techniques. The chosen approach should align with the specific characteristics of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis.\nDealing with Rare or Unseen Categories: In real-world datasets, categorical variables may contain rare or unseen categories that were not present in the training data. Target encoding such categories based solely on the training set may lead to biased or unreliable results. To address this issue, consider techniques such as frequency thresholding or combining rare categories into a single group. Additionally, incorporating domain knowledge or external data sources can aid in properly handling rare categories during encoding.\nPreventing Overfitting and Data Leakage: Overfitting and data leakage are significant concerns when using target encoding within nested cross-validation. To mitigate these risks, ensure that the encoding is performed solely on the training folds during cross-validation. This prevents information from the validation set from influencing the encoding process, leading to more reliable model evaluation. By adhering to this practice, the model can generalize better to unseen data and provide more accurate performance estimates."

Overfitting happens when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data, usually due to the model being too complex. This results in low training error but higher test error.\nTo prevent overfitting, regularization techniques are used to help the model focus on learning meaningful patterns instead of memorizing the training data.Early stoppingis one such technique that stops training once the model shows signs of overfitting and ensures it generalizes better to new data."

It prevents the model from performing well on the training set but underperforming on unseen data i.e validation set. Training stops when performance improves on the training set but degrades on the validation set, promoting better generalization while saving time and resources.\nThe technique monitors the model’s performance on both the training and validation sets. If the validation performance worsens, training stops and the model retains the best weights from the period of optimal validation performance.\n\nEarly stopping is an efficient method when training data is limited as it typically requires fewer epochs than other techniques.

This allows the model to learn more complex data patterns and model intricate relationships between features.\nSparse Activation:ReLU's ability to output zero for negative inputs introduces sparsity in the network, meaning that only a fraction of neurons activate at any given time. This can lead to more efficient and faster computation.\nGradient Computation:ReLU offers computational advantages in terms of backpropagation, as its derivative is simple—either 0 (when the input is negative) or 1 (when the input is positive).

How well this line captures the trend in the data depends on the complexity of the model you use.\nWhen a model is too simple, like fitting a straight line to curved data, it hashigh biasand fails to capture the true relationship, leading tounderfitting. For example, a linear model cannot represent a non-linear increase in house prices with size.\nHowever, if the model becomes too complex, like a fourth-degree polynomial that adjusts to every point, it developshigh variance, overfits the training data, and struggles to generalize to new data. This isoverfitting, where the model performs well on training but poorly on testing.\nAn ideal model strikes a balance withlow bias and low variance, capturing the overall pattern without overreacting to noise.

This means the presence of one word doesn't affect the presence of another word which makes the model easy to use.\nThe model looks at how many times each word appears in messages from different categories (like \"spam\" or \"not spam\"). For example if the word \"free\" appears often in spam messages that will be used to help predict whether a new message is spam or not.\nTo calculate the probability of a message belonging to a certain category Multinomial Naive Bayes uses themultinomial distribution:\nWhere:\nn is the total number of trials.\nn_iis the count of occurrences for outcome i.\np_iis the probability of outcome i.\nTo estimate how likely each word is in a particular class like \"spam\" or \"not spam\" we use a method calledMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).This helps finding probabilities based on actual counts from our data.

Consider the following data:\nThe above-given data is a hypothetical dataset of transactions with each letter representing an item. The frequency of each individual item is computed:-\nLet the minimum support be 3. AFrequent Pattern setis built which will contain all the elements whose frequency is greater than or equal to the minimum support. These elements are stored in descending order of their respective frequencies. After insertion of the relevant items, the set L looks like this:-L = {K : 5, E : 4, M : 3, O : 4, Y : 3}Now for each transaction the respectiveOrdered-Item setis built. It is done by iterating the Frequent Pattern set and checking if the current item is contained in the transaction in question. If the current item is contained the item is inserted in the Ordered-Item set for the current transaction. The following table is built for all the transactions:\nNow all the Ordered-Item sets are inserted into a Tree Data Structure.a) Inserting the set {K, E, M, O, Y}Here all the items are simply linked one after the other in the order of occurrence in the set and initialise the support count for each item as 1. For inserting {K, E, M, O, Y} we traverse the tree from the root. If a node already exists for an item, we increase its support count. If it doesn’t exist, we create a new node for that item and link it to the previous item.\nb) Inserting the set {K, E, O, Y}Till the insertion of the elements K and E, simply the support count is increased by 1. On inserting O we can see that there is no direct link between E and O, therefore a new node for the item O is initialized with the support count as 1 and item E is linked to this new node. On inserting Y, we first initialize a new node for the item Y with support count as 1 and link the new node of O with the new node of Y.\nc) Inserting the set {K, E, M}Here simply the support count of each element is increased by 1.\nd) Inserting the set {K, M, Y}Similar to step b), first the support count of K is increased, then new nodes for M and Y are initialized and linked accordingly.\n\ne) Inserting the set {K, E, O}Here simply the support counts of the respective elements are increased. Note that the support count of the new node of item O is increased.\nThe Conditional Pattern Base for each item consists of the set of prefixes of all paths in the FP-tree that lead to that item. Note that the items in the below table are arranged in the ascending order of their frequencies.\nNow for each item, theConditional Frequent Pattern Tree is built.It is done by taking the set of elements that is common in all the paths in the Conditional Pattern Base of that item and calculating its support count by summing the support counts of all the paths in the Conditional Pattern Base.\nFrom the Conditional Frequent Pattern tree theFrequent Pattern rulesare generated by pairing the items of the Conditional Frequent Pattern Tree set to the corresponding to the item as given in the below table.\nFor each row two types of association rules can be inferred for example for the first row which contains the element, the rulesK -> Y and Y -> Kcan be inferred. To determine the valid rule, the confidence of both the rules is calculated and the one with confidence greater than or equal to the minimum confidence value is retained.\nFrequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm improves upon the Apriori algorithm by eliminating the need for multiple database scans and reducing computational overhead. By using a Tree data structure and focusing on ordered-item sets it efficiently mines frequent item sets making it a faster and more scalable solution for large datasets making it useful tool for data mining."

It defines where the cluster is centered.\nCovariance (Σ):The covariance matrix describes the shape, size and orientation of the cluster. Unlike simpler clustering methods such as K-Means which assume spherical (circular) clusters, the covariance allows Gaussian components to take on elliptical shapes. This means clusters can be stretched, compressed or tilted depending on the relationships between features.\nTo visualize these concepts, consider two sets of data points generated from two Gaussians with different means and covariances:\nScatter plots show the raw data points clustered around their respective means.\nOverlaidkernel density estimate(KDE) contours represent the smooth shape of each Gaussian, illustrating the cluster’s distribution and spread.\nThis visualization highlights the flexibility of GMMs to model clusters that are not necessarily spherical and can overlap, making them more powerful than simpler methods like K-Means that assume equally sized, spherical clusters. By adjusting the mean and covariance, GMM adapts to the true underlying data distribution more accurately."

These values represent the likelihood of the point belonging to each cluster. Unlike hard clustering, a point can partially belong to multiple clusters simultaneously.\nFor example, for 2 clusters and 4 data points, an initial membership matrix (\\gamma) might look like:\nStep 2: Compute Cluster Centroids:Cluster centroids are calculated as the weighted average of all data points, where weights are the membership values raised to the fuzziness parameter m. Points with higher membership influence centroids more.\nThe centroid coordinatev_{ij}for clusteriand featurejis:\nWhere:\n\\gamma_{ik}​ = membership of point k in clusteri.\nm= fuzziness parameter (usually 2).\nx_{kj}​ = value of feature j for pointk.\nStep 3: Calculate Distance Between Data Points and Centroids:Compute the Euclidean distance between each point and every centroid to determine proximity, which will be used to update memberships. Example for point (1,3):\nSimilarly the distance of all other points is computed from both the centroids.\nStep 4: Update Membership Values:Membership values are updated inversely proportional to these distances. Points closer to a centroid get higher membership.\nUpdated membership\\gamma_{ik}for point k in clusteriis:\nStep 5: Repeat Until Convergence:Steps 2–4 are repeated until the membership values stabilize meaning there are no significant changes from one iteration to the next. This indicates that the clustering has reached an optimal state."

If we try to separate these classes with a straight line it can't be done because the data is not linearly separable in its current form.\nWhen we use a kernel function it transforms the original 2D data like the concentric circles into a higher-dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable. In that higher-dimensional space the SVM finds a simple straight-line decision boundary to separate the classes.\nWhen we bring this straight-line decision boundary back to the original 2D space it no longer looks like a straight line.

If the dataset contains unusually high values (like a few people earning extremely high incomes) it may distort the results.

If the data is already normally distributed, calculating skewness isn't necessary, as it will be close to zero, offering little additional information.\nExample scenario:A retail analyst might use skewness to analyze monthly sales data for a product.

High kurtosis might signal that we need to pay attention to outliers, or that the data might be prone to extreme values that could affect the performance of certain models.\nNot suitable: For normal data, where the tails are not of particular interest. If a dataset is already fairly well-behaved with a near-normal distribution, kurtosis might not provide additional value.\nExample scenario:A risk manager analyzing daily stock returns might calculate kurtosis to identify potential for extreme loss days.

It reduces the influence of extreme outliers by compressing large values.\nBest used:The log transformation is particularly useful for data that exhibits large positive skew or exponential growth, such as income or population data. For example, applying a log transformation to income data can make the distribution more symmetric and reduce the effect of extreme income values.\nNot suitable:It’s not effective for data that already follows a normal distribution or doesn’t exhibit strong skewness. For such data, applying a log transformation could unnecessarily distort the data.\nExample:If we have a dataset of household incomes, we might apply a log transformation to make the distribution more symmetric, as incomes are often highly skewed with a few extremely high-income outliers."

    "input": "5.2. Polynomial Features",
    "output": "Polynomial features create new features by combining existing ones through polynomial terms, such as squares or cubes. This allows linear models to capture non-linear relationships.\nBest used:Polynomial features are useful when there’s a non-linear relationship between the features and the target variable. For instance, if we're modeling house prices, adding polynomial features like square or cubic terms of the square footage can help capture non-linear relationships.\nNot suitable:When the relationship between the features and the target is inherently linear. Polynomial features can lead to overfitting in such cases, especially if the degree of the polynomial is too high.\nExample:If we're predicting house prices and there’s a non-linear relationship between the square footage of a house and its price, adding polynomial features (e.g., square footage squared) can help capture that complexity."
  },
  {
    "input": "5.3. Interaction Features",
    "output": "Interaction features are created by combining two or more features to capture the combined effect that they might have on the target variable. These features are valuable when we believe that the impact of one feature depends on the value of another feature.\nBest used:Interaction features are particularly useful when we suspect that two features together have a joint effect on the target variable. For example, combining age and income might reveal an interaction effect on the likelihood of purchasing luxury items.\nNot suitable:Overuse of interaction features can lead to overfitting, especially if we add too many combinations without proper justification. It's important to add only those interactions that have meaningful, interpretable impacts.\nExample:A retailer could create an interaction feature between age and income to model the likelihood of purchasing high-end electronics. Younger consumers with high incomes might behave differently from older consumers with similar incomes and the interaction term would capture this nuanced relationship."

  {
    "input": "6.1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
    "output": "PCA is a linear technique that reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming the original features into a smaller set of uncorrelated features called principal components. These components capture the maximum variance in the data.\nBest used:PCA is useful when we want to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of the variability in the data. For example, PCA can be applied to financial data to reduce multiple correlated variables (such as stock returns) into fewer principal components that capture the majority of the variance.\nNot suitable:PCA is not effective for datasets where the features are non-linearly related, as it only captures linear relationships. Additionally, it’s not ideal if the data contains categorical variables that can’t be easily represented in a continuous space.\nExample:In a dataset with a large number of features representing customer behavior in an e-commerce platform, PCA can help reduce the dimensions and create new features (principal components) that capture the main patterns in customer behavior."

    "output": "t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that’s particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. It works by modeling pairwise similarities between points in high-dimensional space and attempting to preserve these similarities in lower-dimensional space.\nBest used: t-SNE is most useful for visualizing high-dimensional data, such as clustering results or complex datasets. It can help uncover patterns or clusters that are not easily visible in higher dimensions. For example, we might use t-SNE to visualize the clusters of customers based on their purchasing behavior.\nNot suitable: t-SNE is computationally expensive and can struggle with very large datasets. It also doesn’t preserve global relationships, so it might distort distances between data points, making it unsuitable for tasks requiring precise relationships.\nExample:In a dataset containing features like customer age, income and purchase history, t-SNE could be used to visualize how customers cluster based on purchasing behavior in a two-dimensional plot, helping us identify customer segments."

UMAP works by constructing a graph of the data and then embedding it in a lower-dimensional space while maintaining as much of the original data’s structure as possible.\nBest used:UMAP is ideal for visualizing high-dimensional data and is especially useful for large datasets. It can preserve both the local and global structure of the data, making it suitable for tasks like clustering, classification, or anomaly detection. For example, UMAP is often used in genomics or image analysis to reduce the dimensionality of gene expression data or image feature vectors.\nNot suitable:Like t-SNE, UMAP can distort data points’ exact distances, so it’s not suitable for tasks requiring precise distance metrics. It also requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to get optimal results.\nExample:A data scientist might use UMAP to visualize the features of customer interactions with an online store, reducing high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions to uncover trends or clusters that might indicate potential marketing strategies."

To build and train our model we use the following code:\nNow that we have our model ready we need to define the format of the data we are going to provide to our model to make the predictions. This step is import because our model works on numerical data, and we don't want to feed the data of any other type to our model, in order to do this we need to validate that the data we receive follows that norm.\nThe Request Body:\nThe data sent from the client side to the API is called arequest body.The data sent from API to the client is called aresponse body.\nTo define ourrequest bodywe'll use BaseModel ,inpydanticmodule, and define the format of the data we'll send to the API. To define ourrequest body,we'll create a class that inherits BaseModel and define the features as the attributes of that class along with their type hints. What pydantic does is that it defines these type hints during runtime and generates an error when data is invalid. So let's create our request_body class:-\nNow that we have a request body all that's left to do is to add an endpoint that'll predict the class and return it as a response :\nAnd there we have our ML model deployed as an API. Now all that's left to do is test it out.\nTesting our API:\nTo test our API we'll be using Swagger UI now to access that you'll just need to add/docsat the end of your path. So go tohttp://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.And you should see the following output:\nNow click on theTry it Outbutton and enter the data you want the prediction for:\nAfter you've entered all the values click onExecute,after this you can see your output under the responses section:\nAnd as you can see we got our class as the response.

It is difficult to generalize for a model only with help of a single example. There are more chances of errors in the results when the model is trained with one-shot learning.\nZero shot learning:In zero shot learning, the model needs to recognize the classes which were not seen on the training time. It has to find a relationship between seen and unseen classes on the basis of some semantic relations or auxiliary information present.\nN shot learning:In n-shot learning, n number of examples are given to train the model. They are more than one but still less than data required for training insupervised learning. This approach is more reliable for training of a model to get optimized results."

These networks are trained to minimize the distance between similar objects and maximize the distance between different objects. If the output is less than threshold value, the classes are different, else, if the output is equal to or greater than threshold value, the classes are similar.\nModel Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML):It is an approach of meta-learning in which the model is trained to adapt new tasks quickly. The model learns an initialization that is fine tuned by some examples for a specific task. It is hard to train as the method is more complex. It does not work well on the few shot learning classification benchmarks as compared to other metric algorithms.\nPrototypical Networks:In prototype learning, the model learns the prototype of each class based on embedding of its instances. During training, the model minimizes the distance between the embeddings of instances and the prototype for each class. It is an effective measure of implementing few shot learning technique for classification.\nTriplet Networks:It is an extension to the Siamese Network. It consists of triplets of instances, i.e., Anchor, Positive example, Negative example. The model is trained to minimize the difference between anchor and positive example (which is similar to the anchor) and maximize the distance between anchor and negative example (which is different from the anchor).\nMatching Networks:Matching networks starts by looking at support set provided to model. Then, when a new query comes, it pays attention to the most similar class present and compare its similarities and dissimilarities with the query set.

It's a simple approach but it doesn't account for the relationships between variables.\nIn this example, we are explaining the imputation techniques for handling missing values in the 'Marks' column of the DataFrame (df). It calculates and fills missing values with the mean, median and mode of the existing values in that column and then prints the results for observation.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(df['Marks'].mean()): Fills missing values in the 'Marks' column with themeanvalue.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(df['Marks'].median()): Fills missing values in the 'Marks' column with the median value.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(df['Marks'].mode():Fills missing values in the 'Marks' column with themodevalue.\n.iloc[0]:Accesses the first element of the Series which represents the mode.\nOutput:\nAdvantages:\nSimple and efficient:Easy to implement and quick.\nWorks well with numerical data:It is useful for numerical variables with a normal distribution.\nDisadvantages:\nInaccuracy:It assumes the missing value is similar to the central tendency (mean/median/mode) which may not always be the case.\n2.2 Forward and Backward Fill\nForward and backward fill techniques are used to replace missing values by filling them with the nearest non-missing values from the same column. This is useful when there’s an inherent order or sequence in the data.\nThe method parameter infillna()allows to specify the filling strategy.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(method='ffill'):This method fills missing values in the 'Marks' column of the DataFrame (df) using a forward fill strategy. It replaces missing values with the last observed non-missing value in the column.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(method='bfill'):This method fills missing values in the 'Marks' column using a backward fill strategy. It replaces missing values with the next observed non-missing value in the column.\nOutput:\nAdvantages:\nSimple and Intuitive:Preserves the temporal or sequential order in data.\nPreserves Patterns:Fills missing values logically, especially in time-series or ordered data.\nDisadvantages:\nAssumption of Closeness:Assumes that the missing values are similar to the observed values nearby which may not always be true.\nPotential Inaccuracy:May not work well if there are large gaps between non-missing values."

Containerize ML Models: Package models in containers (e.g., Docker) to ensure they run consistently across environments. Containerization also makes deployment and scaling much simpler.\n7. Implement CI/CD for ML: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for models. Automate testing, validation and deployment so new versions can go live quickly and safely.\n8. Monitor Models in Production: Track metrics like accuracy, latency and prediction quality. Detect data or concept drift early and identify any issues before they impact users.\n9. Enable Automated Retraining: Set up pipelines that automatically retrain models when performance drops or when new data arrives. This keeps models up-to-date and accurate over time.\n10.

In fact, NASA created the technology forautonomous drivingfor Mars Rovers almost a decade ago. A Machine Learning navigation and driving system for self-driving Mars rovers known asAutoNavwas actually used in theSpiritandOpportunityrovers which landed on Mars as early as 2004. Another rover launched in 2011,Curiosityalso uses Autonav and it is a rover that is still exploring Mars to date with the mission of finding water and other factors that might make Mars suitable for human exploration in the future! Now you would think that driving on Mars is comparatively easier than driving on the congested roads of Earth. But it’s not so easy! While AutoNav does not have to worry about the rover hitting other vehicles or humans (There is no life found on Mars yet!), the surface of Mars is very rocky so the navigation system has to make sure that the rover does not hit rocks or slippery sand dunes that would trap it permanently.\nAnother application of Machine Learning in the Mars rovers is an algorithm calledAEGIS(Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science) which identifies Martian rock formations that might be interesting on their own by using Machine Learning This is because the rover cannot send all the pictures of Mars it snaps back on Earth because there is only limited communication possible. So AEGIS decides which pictures might be interesting or important and then the rover sends them back to Earth for the NASA scientists to study."

These healthcare options will be created by certified doctors and surgeons and they will learn and evolve with time according to the astronaut experiences.\nAll in all, the main aim of the Exploration Medical Capability is that astronauts stay fit and healthy in space (Especially on long and far-away missions). And unlike what comic books tell you about space, some of the common health risks associated with space travel areradiation hazards, harsh environmental challenges, issues due to gravitational changes,etc. In these situations, the astronauts cannot directly contact doctors on Earth as there is a time lag and so the ExMC uses machine learning to provide self-reliant autonomous medical care with the help of remote medical technologies."

This is not science fiction, NASA actually believes we may find aliens one day! But for discovering aliens, NASA first needs to discover more and more new planets in different solar systems. Once theseexoplanetsare discovered, then NASA measures the atmospheric spectrum of these planets to find if there is any possibility of life. While these steps are complicated enough, the problem is that there is no real data available for experimentation! So NASA scientists just generate the required data and that's where Machine Learning comes in. ThePlanetary Spectrum Generatoris a tool that NASA uses to create3-D orbitsandatmospheric propertiesof the exoplanets they find. To create a working model for the solar system, scientists uselinear regressionas well asconvolutional neural networks. Then further fine-tuning is conducted on the model before it is ready for training.\nThe above image demonstrates the results generated for an exoplanet that demonstrate the amount of water and methane in the atmosphere.

This was necessary as it would increase NASA's capacity for research and discovery in space which would, in turn, allow us to learn more about the solar system and all of this has become easy with machine learning.\n\nAs you can see from this image, Robonaut is now an essential helper in space! To achieve this, Robonaut basically usesMachine Learningto \"think\" for itself. So the scientists or astronauts can give tasks to the Robonaut and figures out how to perform them. In general, Robonaut also has many advantages over normal humans likeadvanced sensors, insanely high speeds, compact design,and muchhigher flexibility.

Currently, theNASA Frontier Development Labis working on a project to provide navigation on the surface of celestial bodies including the moon! This project basically aims to provide GPS even on the lunar surface, just without using multiple very expensive satellites! And that is not an easy task keeping in mind the rocky and barren lunar surface:\n\nThis is done by feeding a Machine Learning System lots of images of the moon(2.4 million in this case which luckily NASA already has!)and then creating a virtual version of the moon using neural networks. Then if you are lost on the Moon, you can take images of your surroundings and the Machine Learning System will be able to triangulate your location on the moon by comparing your images with the already created image database of the lunar surface that constitutes the virtual moon. While this technique isn't perfect (yet!), it is still much better than anything already available and can be used on any planetary surface, not just the moon.

Instead of giving a computer step-by-step instructions for every task, we give it lots of data and let it learn patterns and rules from that data. For example, if we want a computer to recognize photos of cats, we don’t have to tell it what a cat looks like. Instead, we show it many pictures of cats and non-cats. Over time, the computer learns the difference and can say, “This is a cat!” when it sees a new photo.\nMachine Learning is used in many everyday things like voice assistants (like Siri or Alexa), online recommendations (like YouTube or Amazon), and even self-driving cars. It’s all about helping machines get smarter over time by learning from the data they see."

Feedback is provided to correct the error \"Wrong! It's an apple\" and the system updates its model based on this feedback.\nOver time it learns to respond correctly that \"It's an apple\" when getting similar inputs and also improves accuracy.\nBesides these three main types, modern machine learning also includes two other important approaches:Self-Supervised LearningandSemi-Supervised Learning."

    "input": "Brief Summary of Linear Regression",
    "output": "Linear Regression is a very common statistical method that allows us to learn a function or relationship from a given set of continuous data. For example, we are given some data points of x and corresponding y and we need to learn the relationship between them which is called ahypothesis.\nIn the case of Linear regression, the hypothesis is a straight line, i.e,h(x) = wx + bWhere w is a vector calledWeightsand b is a scalar calledBias. The Weights and Bias are called theparametersof the model.\nAll we need to do is estimate the value of w and b from the given set of data such that the resultant hypothesis produces the least cost J which is defined by the followingcost functionJ(w, b) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - h(x_i)) ^ 2where m is the number of data points in the given dataset. This cost function is also calledMean Squared Error.\nFor finding the optimized value of the parameters for which J is minimum, we will be using a commonly used optimizer algorithm calledGradient Descent. Following is the pseudo-code for Gradient Descent:\nRepeat until Convergence {    w = w - α * δJ/δw    b = b - α * δJ/δb}where α is ahyperparametercalled theLearning Rate.\nLinear regression is a widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. TensorFlow is a popular open-source software library for data processing, machine learning, and deep learning applications. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using Tensorflow for linear regression:\nAdvantages:\nScalability:Tensorflow is designed to handle large datasets and can easily scale up to handle more data and more complex models.Flexibility: Tensorflow provides a flexible API that allows users to customize their models and optimize their algorithms.Performance: Tensorflow can run on multiple GPUs and CPUs, which can significantly speed up the training process and improve performance.Integration:Tensorflow can be integrated with other open-source libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which makes it easier to preprocess and visualize data.\nDisadvantages:\nComplexity: Tensorflow has a steep learning curve and requires a good understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts.Computational resources: Running Tensorflow on large datasets requires high computational resources, which can be expensive.Debugging: Debugging errors in Tensorflow can be challenging, especially when working with complex models.Overkill for simple models: Tensorflow can be overkill for simple linear regression models and may not be necessary for smaller datasets.Overall, using Tensorflow for linear regression has many advantages, but it also has some disadvantages. When deciding whether to use Tensorflow or not, it is essential to consider the complexity of the model, the size of the dataset, and the available computational resources."

These coefficients establish the decision boundary that divides the classes. Because of its ease of use, interpretability, and versatility across multiple domains, Logistic Regression is widely used in machine learning for problems that involve binary outcomes.

The data is divided into testing (X_test, y_test) and training (X_train, y_train) sets. Twenty percent of the data will be used for testing, according to the setting test_size=0.2.

The adjacency matrix can be built in the following manners:\nEpsilon-neighbourhood Graph:A parameter epsilon is fixed beforehand. Then, each point is connected to all the points which lie in its epsilon-radius. If all the distances between any two points are similar in scale then typically the weights of the edges ie the distance between the two points are not stored since they do not provide any additional information. Thus, in this case, the graph built is an undirected and unweighted graph.\nK-Nearest NeighboursA parameter k is fixed beforehand. Then, for two vertices u and v, an edge is directed from u to v only if v is among the k-nearest neighbours of u. Note that this leads to the formation of a weighted and directed graph because it is not always the case that for each u having v as one of the k-nearest neighbours, it will be the same case for v having u among its k-nearest neighbours. To make this graph undirected, one of the following approaches is followed:-Direct an edge from u to v and from v to u if either v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uORu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.Direct an edge from u to v and from v to u if v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uANDu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.Fully-Connected Graph:To build this graph, each point is connected with an undirected edge-weighted by the distance between the two points to every other point. Since this approach is used to model the local neighbourhood relationships thus typically the Gaussian similarity metric is used to calculate the distance.\nDirect an edge from u to v and from v to u if either v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uORu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.\nDirect an edge from u to v and from v to u if v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uANDu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.\nFully-Connected Graph:To build this graph, each point is connected with an undirected edge-weighted by the distance between the two points to every other point. Since this approach is used to model the local neighbourhood relationships thus typically the Gaussian similarity metric is used to calculate the distance.\nProjecting the data onto a lower Dimensional Space:This step is done to account for the possibility that members of the same cluster may be far away in the given dimensional space. Thus the dimensional space is reduced so that those points are closer in the reduced dimensional space and thus can be clustered together by a traditional clustering algorithm. It is done by computing theGraph Laplacian Matrix.\nTo compute it though first, the degree of a node needs to be defined. The degree of the ith node is given byd_{i} = \\sum _{j=1|(i, j)\\epsilon E}^{n} w_{ij}Note thatw_{ij}is the edge between the nodes i and j as defined in the adjacency matrix above.\nThe degree matrix is defined as follows:-D_{ij} = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} d_{i}, i=j & \\\\0, i\\neq j & \\end{matrix}\\right.\nThus the Graph Laplacian Matrix is defined as:-L = D-A\nThis Matrix is then normalized for mathematical efficiency. To reduce the dimensions, first, the eigenvalues and the respective eigenvectors are calculated. If the number of clusters is k then the first eigenvalues and their eigenvectors are taken and stacked into a matrix such that the eigenvectors are the columns.\nCode For Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvector of the matrix in Python\n\nClustering the Data:This process mainly involves clustering the reduced data by using any traditional clustering technique - typically K-Means Clustering. First, each node is assigned a row of the normalized of the Graph Laplacian Matrix. Then this data is clustered using any traditional technique. To transform the clustering result, the node identifier is retained.\nProperties:"

    "output": "There are several concepts related to support vector regression (SVR) that you may want to understand in order to use it effectively. Here are a few of the most important ones:\nSupport vector machines (SVMs):SVR is a type ofsupport vector machine(SVM), a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. SVMs try to find the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates different classes or output values.\nKernels:SVR can use different types of kernels, which are functions that determine the similarity between input vectors. A linear kernel is a simple dot product between two input vectors, while a non-linear kernel is a more complex function that can capture more intricate patterns in the data. The choice of kernel depends on the data's characteristics and the task's complexity.\nHyperparameters:SVR has severalhyperparametersthat you can adjust to control the behavior of the model. For example, the'C'parameter controls the trade-off between the insensitive loss and the sensitive loss. A larger value of'C'means that the model will try to minimize the insensitive loss more, while a smaller value of C means that the model will be more lenient in allowing larger errors.\nModel evaluation:Like anymachine learningmodel, it's important to evaluate the performance of an SVR model. One common way to do this is to split the data into a training set and a test set, and use the training set to fit the model and the test set to evaluate it. You can then use metrics likemean squared error (MSE)ormean absolute error (MAE)to measure the error between the predicted and true output values."

Each time we feed in data, they learn and add the data to their knowledge which is training data.

The Q-function estimates the expected reward of taking a particular action in a given state.\nSARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):SARSA is another model-free RL algorithm that learns a Q-function. However, unlike Q-learning, SARSA updates the Q-function for the action that was actually taken, rather than the optimal action.\nDeep Q-learning:Deep Q-learning is a combination of Q-learning and deep learning.

    "output": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) building blocks include all the aspects that power learning and empower agents to make wise judgements in their surroundings. Effective learning frameworks are produced by the cooperative interactions of these elements. The following are the essential elements:\nAgent: The decision-maker or learner who engages with the environment. The agent acts in accordance with its policy and gains experience over time to improve its ability to make decisions.\nEnvironment: The system outside of the agent that it communicates with. Based on the actions the agent does, it gives the agent feedback in the form of incentives or punishments.\nState: A depiction of the current circumstance or environmental state at a certain moment. The agent chooses its activities and makes decisions based on the state.\nAction: A choice the agent makes that causes a change in the state of the system. The policy of the agent guides the selection of actions.Reward: A scalar feedback signal from the environment that shows whether an agent's behaviour in a specific state is desirable. The agent is guided by rewards to learn positive behaviour.\\\nPolicy: A plan that directs the agent's decision-making by mapping states to actions. Finding an ideal policy that maximises cumulative rewards is the objective.\nValue Function: This function calculates the anticipated cumulative reward an agent can obtain from a specific state while adhering to a specific policy. It is beneficial in assessing and contrasting states and policies.\nModel: A depiction of the dynamics of the environment that enables the agent to simulate potential results of actions and states. Models are useful for planning and forecasting.\nExploration-Exploitation Strategy: A method of making decisions that strikes a balance between exploring new actions to learn more and exploiting well-known acts to reap immediate benefits (exploitation).\nLearning Algorithm:The process by which the agent modifies its value function or policy in response to experiences gained from interacting with the environment. Learning in DRL is fueled by a variety of algorithms, including Q-learning, policy gradient, and actor-critic.\nDeep Neural Networks:DRL can handle high-dimensional state and action spaces by acting as function approximators in deep neural networks. They pick up intricate input-to-output mappings.\nExperience Replay:A method that randomly selects from stored prior experiences (state, action, reward, and next state) during training. As a result, learning stability is improved and the association between subsequent events is decreased.\nThese core components collectively form the foundation ofDeep Reinforcement Learning, empowering agents to learn strategies, make intelligent decisions, and adapt to dynamic environments."

This breakthrough heralded a new era in which DRL could perform difficult tasks by directly learning from unprocessed sensory inputs.\nThrough the years, scientists have made considerable strides in solving these problems. Policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimisation (TRPO) provide learning stability. Actor-critical architectures integrate policy- and value-based strategies for increased convergence. The application of distributional reinforcement learning and multi-step bootstrapping techniques has increased learning effectiveness and stability.\nIn order to accelerate learning, researchers are investigating methods to incorporate prior knowledge into DRL algorithms. By dividing challenging tasks into smaller subtasks, reinforcement in hierarchical learning increases learning effectiveness. DRL uses pre-trained models to encourage fast learning in unfamiliar scenarios, bridging the gap between simulations and real-world situations.\nThe use of model-based and model-free hybrid approaches is growing. By developing a model of the environment to guide decision-making, model-based solutions aim to increase sampling efficiency. Two exploration tactics that try to more successfully strike a balance between exploration and exploitation are curiosity-driven exploration and intrinsic motivation."

Smaller layers reduce redundancy and allows efficient encoding.\nRegularization: Techniques likeL1 or L2 regularizationadd penalty terms to the loss function. This prevents overfitting by removing excessively large weights which helps in ensuring the model to learns general and useful representations.\nDenoising:In denoising autoencodersrandom noise is added to the input during training. It learns to remove this noise during reconstruction which helps it focus on core, noise-free features and helps in improving robustness.\nTuning the Activation Functions: Adjusting activation functions can promote sparsity by activating only a few neurons at a time.

Padding involves adding extra pixels around the border of the input feature map before convolution.\nThis can be done in two ways:\nValid Padding: In the valid padding, no padding is added to the input feature map, and the output feature map is smaller than the input feature map. This is useful when we want to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\nSame Padding: In the same padding, padding is added to the input feature map such that the size of the output feature map is the same as the input feature map. This is useful when we want to preserve the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\nThe number of pixels to be added for padding can be calculated based on the size of the kernel and the desired output of the feature map size. The most common padding value is zero-padding, which involves adding zeros to the borders of the input feature map.\nPadding can help in reducing the loss of information at the borders of the input feature map and can improve the performance of the model. However, it also increases the computational cost of the convolution operation. Overall, padding is an important technique in CNNs that helps in preserving the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and can improve the performance of the model."

Thus, the image shrinks every time a convolution operation is performed. This places an upper limit to the number of times such an operation could be performed before the image reduces to nothing thereby precluding us from building deeper networks.\nAlso, the pixels on the corners and the edges are used much less than those in the middle.For example,\nClearly, pixel A is touched in just one convolution operation and pixel B is touched in 3 convolution operations, while pixel C is touched in 9 convolution operations. In general, pixels in the middle are used more often than pixels on corners and edges. Consequently, the information on the borders of images is not preserved as well as the information in the middle."

It takes two inputs:\nRandom Noise (z): A vector of random values that adds diversity to generated outputs.\nConditioning Information (y): Extra data like labels or context that guides what the generator produces for example a class label such as \"cat\" or \"dog\".\nThe generator combines the noise and the conditioning information to produce realistic data that matches the given condition. For example if the condition y is \"cat\" the generator will create an image of a cat.\n2. Discriminator in CGANs: The discriminator is a binary classifier that decides whether input data is real or fake. It also receives two inputs:\nReal Data (x): Actual samples from the dataset.\nConditioning Information (y): The same condition given to the generator.\nUsing both the real/fake data and the condition, the discriminator learns to judge if the data is genuine and if it matches the condition. For example if the input is an image labeled \"cat\" the discriminator verifies whether it truly looks like a real cat.\n3. Interaction Between Generator and Discriminator: The generator and discriminator train together through adversarial training:\nThe generator tries to create fake data based on noise (z) and condition (y) that can fool the discriminator.\nThe discriminator attempts to correctly classify real vs. fake data considering the condition (y).\nThe goal of the adversarial process is:\nGenerator: Produce data that the discriminator believes is real.\nDiscriminator: Accurately distinguish between real and fake data.\n4. Loss Function and Training:Training is guided by a loss function that balances the generator and discriminator:\nmin_G max_D V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{data} (x)}[logD(x|y)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_{z}}(z)[log(1- D(G(z∣y)))]\nThe first term encourages the discriminator to classify real samples correctly.\nThe second term pushes the generator to produce samples that the discriminator classifies as real.\nHere\\mathbb{E}represents the expected valuep_{data}is the real data distribution andp_{z}is the prior noise distribution.\nAs training progresses both the generator and discriminator improve.

Let's first calculate the Jacobian of the hidden layer:\n\\begin{aligned}Z_j &= W_i X_i \\\\ h_j &= \\phi(Z_j)\\end{aligned}\nwhere \\phi is non-linearity.

An essential factor enabling the training of such a deep network is the use of skip connections (also known as shortcut connections). The signal that enters a layer is added to the output of a layer located higher up in the stack. Let's explore why this is beneficial.\nWhen training a neural network, the goal is to make it replicate a target function h(x). By adding the input x to the output of the network (a skip connection), the network is made to model f(x) = h(x) - x, a technique known as residual learning.\nWhen initializing a regular neural network, its weights are near zero, resulting in the network outputting values close to zero. With the addition of skip connections, the resulting network outputs a copy of its inputs, effectively modeling the identity function. This can be beneficial if the target function is similar to the identity function, as it will accelerate training. Furthermore, if multiple skip connections are added, the network can begin to make progress even if several layers have not yet begun learning.\nthe target function is fairly close to the identity function (which is often the case), this will speed up training considerably. Moreover, if you add many skin connections, the network can start making progress even if several\nThe deep residual network can be viewed as a series of residual units, each of which is a small neural network with a skip connection"

This design principle was developed to address the issue of accuracy decline caused by the vanishing and exploding gradients in high-level neural networks.\nAll convolutions in a dense block are ReLU-activated and use batch normalization. Channel-wise concatenation is only possible if the height and width dimensions of the data remain unchanged, so convolutions in a dense block are all of stride 1. Pooling layers are inserted between dense blocks for further dimensionality reduction.\nIntuitively, one might think that by concatenating all previously seen outputs, the number of channels and parameters would exponentially increase. However, DenseNet is surprisingly economical in terms of learnable parameters. This is because each concatenated block, which may have a relatively large number of channels, is first fed through a 1x1 convolution, reducing it to a small number of channels. Additionally, 1x1 convolutions are economical in terms of parameters. Then, a 3x3 convolution with the same number of channels is applied.\nThe resulting channels from each step of the DenseNet are concatenated to the collection of all previously generated outputs. Each step, which utilizes a pair of 1x1 and 3x3 convolutions, adds K channels to the data. Consequently, the number of channels increases linearly with the number of convolutional steps in the dense block. The growth rate remains constant throughout the network, and DenseNet has demonstrated good performance with K values between 12 and 40.\nDense blocks and pooling layers are combined to form a Tu DenseNet network.

They are designed to discover and learn patterns within large sets of data automatically. Imagine them as multi-layered networks, where each layer is capable of making sense of the information received from the previous one, gradually building up a complex understanding of the overall data.\nDBNs are composed of multiple layers of stochastic, or randomly determined, units. These units are known asRestricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)or other similar structures. Each layer in a DBN aims to extract different features from the input data, with lower layers identifying basic patterns and higher layers recognizing more abstract concepts. This structure allows DBNs to effectively learn complex representations of data, which makes them particularly useful for tasks like image and speech recognition, where the input data is high-dimensional and requires a deep level of understanding.\nThe architecture of DBNs also makes them good atunsupervised learning, where the goal is to understand and label input data without explicit guidance. This characteristic is particularly useful in scenarios where labelled data is scarce or when the goal is to explore the structure of the data without any preconceived labels."

During this phase, the network learns the probability distribution of the inputs, which helps it understand the underlying structure of the data.\nIn the fine-tuning phase, the DBN adjusts its parameters for a specific task, like classification or regression. This is typically done using a technique known as backpropagation, where the network’s performance on a task is evaluated, and the errors are used to update the network’s parameters. This phase often involves supervised learning, where the network is trained with labelled data."

At their core, they use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for layer-wise learning, which are based on probabilistic graphical models.\n1.    Energy-Based Model:Each RBM within a DBN is an energy-based model. For an RBM with visible units v and hidden units h, the energy function is defined as:\nE(v,h) = -\\sum _{i}a_i v_i - \\sum _j b_j h_j - \\sum _{i,j} v_j h_j w_{ij}\nHere, ai and bj are bias terms, and wij represents the weights between units.\n2. Probability Distribution:The probability of a given state of the RBM is defined by the Boltzmann distribution:\nP(v,h) = \\frac{e^{-E(v,h)}}{Z}\nwhere Z is the partition function, a normalization factor calculated as the sum over all possible pairs of visible and hidden units.\n3. Training using Contrastive Divergence:RBMs are typically trained using a method called Contrastive Divergence (CD). This method approximates the gradient of the log-likelihood and updates the weights wij, and biases ai,bj to maximize the likelihood of the training data under the model.\nIn a DBN, these RBMs are stacked. The hidden layer of one RBM serves as the visible layer for the next. After this unsupervised, layer-wise training, the entire network can be fine-tuned using supervised methods like backpropagation, where the goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual label of the training data."

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\nImport Libraries:Essential Python libraries for data handling (numpy, pandas), machine learning models (scikit-learn), and deep learning (tensorflow) are imported.\nLoad Dataset:The MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, is fetched using fetch_openml from scikit-learn. This dataset is commonly used for benchmarking classification algorithms.\nPreprocessing:The dataset is split into training and testing sets with train_test_split. The data is then scaled using StandardScaler to normalize it, which often leads to better performance for neural networks.\nRBM Layer:A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is initialized with a specified number of components and learning rate. RBMs are unsupervised neural networks that find patterns in data by reconstructing the inputs.\nClassifier Layer:A logistic regression classifier is chosen for the final prediction layer. Logistic regression is a simple yet effective linear model for classification tasks.\nDBN Pipeline:The RBM and logistic regression model are chained together in a Pipeline. This allows for sequential application of the RBM (for feature extraction) followed by logistic regression (for classification).\nTraining:The pipeline, which forms the DBN, is trained on the preprocessed training data (X_train_scaled). The RBM learns features that are then used by the logistic regression model to classify the digits.\nEvaluation:Finally, the trained DBN's performance is evaluated on the test set. The classification accuracy (dbn_score) is printed to provide a quantitative measure of how well the model performs.\nThis DBN implementation leverages a simple but effective stack of models to learn from the data and perform digit classification. The RBM layers act as feature detectors, converting raw pixel intensities into more useful representations for the logistic regression model to classify.\nOutput:\nThe output shows the training progress of a Deep Belief Network (DBN) over 20 iterations. During each iteration, the RBM part of the DBN is learning to understand the structure of the data. The \"pseudo-likelihood\" is a measure used to estimate how well the RBM is modeling the data. However, the values given are negative and increasing in magnitude, which typically should not happen as we expect the pseudo-likelihood to increase (or loss to decrease) as the model learns.\nAfter training, the DBN achieves a classification score of about 21.14%. This score is a way of measuring accuracy; it tells us that the DBN correctly predicted the digit class 21.14% of the time on the test dataset. This is not a very high score, suggesting the model didn't perform well in this task."

    "input": "Conclusion",
    "output": "The article provided a walkthrough on setting up a Deep Belief Network (DBN), a type of advanced computer program designed to recognize patterns in data. We used handwritten digits as an example. The DBN was trained using a method that involved learning from the data in stages, with each stage hoping to get better at spotting the various digits.\nHowever, the training updates showed a peculiar trend where the model's estimation of doing a good job (pseudo-likelihood) kept getting worse. Ideally, this number should get better as the model sees more data. After the training, when the DBN was tested to see how well it could identify new handwritten digits, it only got it right about 21% of the time. This score is quite low, suggesting that the DBN didn't learn as effectively as we would have liked.\nIn simple terms, it's like the DBN was a student who, despite studying more, wasn't getting better at passing tests. This outcome suggests that the DBN might need a different study strategy, perhaps a change in how it learns from the data or the kind of data it learns from. To improve its performance, we might need to adjust the training process or try different ways of teaching the DBN about handwritten digits."

A decoder does the opposite - it takes that special format and turns it back into the original information. Think of them like a secret code. The encoder writes the message in code, and the decoder reads the code to understand the message. This is useful because sometimes the coded version is smaller or safer to send.\nFor example when you send a picture online, an encoder might make the file smaller so it sends faster. Then, a decoder on the other end turns it back into a picture you can see. Without encoders and decoders, many things we do with computers and phones would be much harder or slower."

Additionally, it initializes a running sum of squared gradients for each parameter which will track the gradients over time.\n2. Gradient Calculation:For each training step, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters is calculated, just like in standard gradient descent.\n3. Adaptive Learning Rate:The key difference comes next. Instead of using a fixed learning rate, Adagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the accumulated sum of squared gradients.\nThe updated learning rate for each parameter is calculated as follows:\nWhere:\n\\etais the global learning rate (a small constant value)\nG_t​ is the sum of squared gradients for a given parameter up to time stept\nϵis a small value added to avoid division by zero (often set to1e−8)\nHere, the denominator\\sqrt{G_t + \\epsilon}​ grows as the squared gradients accumulate, causing the learning rate to decrease over time which helps to stabilize the training.\n4. Parameter Update:The model's parameters are updated by subtracting the product of the adaptive learning rate and the gradient at each step:\nWhere:\n\\theta_t​ is the current parameter\n\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameter"

Use MSE or MAE for regression, Cross-Entropy for classification, Contrastive or Triplet Loss for ranking and Dice or Jaccard Loss for image segmentation.\nConsider the Output Type: You should also think about the type of output your model produces. If the output is a continuous number use regression loss functions like MSE or MAE, classification losses for labels and CTC Loss for sequence outputs like speech or handwriting.\nHandle Imbalanced Data: If your dataset is imbalanced  one class appears much more often than others it's important to use a loss function that can handle this. Focal Loss is useful for such cases because it focuses more on the harder-to-predict or rare examples and help the model learn better from them.\nRobust to Outliers: When your data has outliers it’s better to use a loss function that’s less sensitive to them. Huber Loss is a good option because it combines the strengths of both MSE and MAE and make it more robust and stable when outliers are present.\nPerformance and Convergence: Choose loss functions that help your model converge faster and perform better. For example using Hinge Loss for SVMs can sometimes lead to better performance than Cross-Entropy for classification.\nLoss function helps in evaluation and optimization. Understanding different types of loss functions and their applications is important for designing effective deep learning models."

    "input": "1. Supervised Models",

    "input": "1.1 Classification",
    "output": "The classifier algorithms are designed to indicate whether a new data point belongs to one or another among several predefined classes. Imagine when you are organising emails into spam or inbox, categorising images as cat or dog, or predicting whether a loan applicant is a credible borrower. In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes. After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points.\nCommon Classification Algorithms:\nLogistic Regression:A very efficient technique for the classification problems of binary nature (two types, for example, spam/not spam).\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM):Good for tasks like classification, especially when the data has a large number of features.\nDecision Tree:Constructs a decision tree having branches and proceeds to the class predictions through features.\nRandom Forest:The model generates an \"ensemble\" of decision trees that ultimately raise the accuracy and avoid overfitting (meaning that the model performs great on the training data but lousily on unseen data).\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):Assigns a label of the nearest neighbors for a given data point."

This value could be anything such as predicting real estate prices or stock market trends to anticipating customer churn (how likely customers stay) and sales forecasting. Regression models make the use of features to understand the relationship among the continuous features and the output variable. That is, they use the pattern that is learned to determine the value of the new data points.\nCommon Regression Algorithms\nLinear Regression:Fits depth of a line to the data to model for the relationship between features and the continuous output.\nPolynomial Regression:Similiar to linear regression but uses more complex polynomial functions such as quadratic, cubic, etc, for accommodating non-linear relationships of the data.\nDecision Tree Regression:Implements a decision tree-based algorithm that predicts a continuous output variable from a number of branching decisions.\nRandom Forest Regression:Creates one from several decision trees to guarantee error-free and robust regression prediction results.\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR):Adjusts the Support Vector Machine ideas for regression tasks, where we are trying to find one hyperplane that most closely reflects continuous output data."

Techniques like K-means clustering are defined by exact number of clusters (\"red fruits\" and \"green fruits\") and then each data point (fruit) is assigned to the cluster with the highest similarity within based on features (color, size, texture). Contrary to this, hierarchical clustering features construction of hierarchy of clusters which makes it more easy to study the system of groups. Spatial clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) detects groups of high-density data points, even in those areas where there is a lack of data or outliers."

The purpose of dimensionality reduction methods is to decrease the dimensions needed to maintain the key features. Dimensions of greatest importance are identified byprincipal component analysis (PCA), which is the reason why data is concentrated in fewer dimensions with the highest variations. This speeds up model training as well as offers a chance for more efficient visualization. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) also resembles PCA but it is made for classification tasks where it concentrates on dimensions that can differentiate the present classes in the dataset."

    "input": "2.3Anomaly Detection",
    "output": "Unsupervised learning can also be applied to find those data points which greatly differ than the majorities. The statistics model may identify these outliers, or anomalies as signaling of errors, fraud or even something unusual. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) makes a comparison of a given data point's local density with those surrounding it. It then flags out the data points with significantly lower densities as outliers or potential anomalies. Isolation Forest is the one which uses different approach, which is to recursively isolate data points according to their features. Anomalies usually are simple to contemplate as they often necessitate fewer steps than an average normal point."

It exploits a generative model to investigate the unlabeled pictures and discover the orchestrating factors that characterize the data. This technique can then be used to generate the new synthetic data points that have the same features with the unlabeled data. The synthetic data is then labeled with the pseudo-labels that the generative model has interpreted from the data. This approach combines the existing labeled data with the newly generated labeled data to train the final model which is likely to perform better than the previous model that was trained with only the limited amount of the original labeled data."

Cluster-based methods can analyze the links between users (friendships) and even apply this information to infer that if a user is connected to someone with a \"sports\" label then this user might also be interested in sports (unbiased labels with propagated label). While links and the entire structure of the network are also important for the distribution of labels.

The main purpose is to help players play the game that can result in the highest rewards."

It has neither a map nor instructions, but it gets points for consuming the cheese at the end and fails with deduction of time when it runs into a wall. Value learning is an offshoot of predicting the anticipated future reward of taking a step in a particular state. For example, the algorithm Q-learning will learn a Q-value for each state-action combination. This Q-value is the expected reward for that action at that specific state. Through a repetitive process of assessing the state, gaining rewards, and updating the Q-values the agent manages to determine that which actions are most valuable in each state and eventually guides it to the most rewarding path. In contrast,SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)looks at the value of the succeeding state-action pair that influences the exploration strategy."

  {
    "input": "4.2 Policy-based learning:",
    "output": "In contrast to the value-based learning, where we are learning a specific value for each state-action pair, in policy-based learning we are trying to directly learn a policy which maps states to actions. This policy in essence commands the agent to act in different situations as specified by the way it is written. Actor-Critic is a common approach that combines two models: an actor that retrains the policy and a critic that retrains the value function (just like value-based methods). The actor witnesses the critic's feedback which updates the policy that the actor uses for better decision making. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a specific policy-based method which focuses on high variance issues that complicate early policy-based learning methods."

    "input": "Can Human Translators be replaced by AI?",
    "output": "Challenges arise as different languages categorize and express concepts in diverse ways, demanding careful consideration in translation. The use of an interlingua, a representation language capturing distinctions among languages, becomes essential. Whether undertaken by humans or machines, effective translation involves grasping the entirety of the scenario presented in the source, not just individual words. Complexities further intensify when dealing with cultural and grammatical nuances, underscoring the intricacies of the translation endeavor.\nIt can be challenging for translators (both machine and human) to make this decision. \"The baseball struck the window,\" for example, maybe translated as \"The baseball hit the window.\" In order to translate \"it broke\" into French, we must pick between the feminine \"elle\" and the masculine \"il,\" indicating whether \"it\" refers to the baseball or the window. To get the translation properly, you'll need to know both physics and language.\nWhile AI and machine translation systems continue to improve, the goal should be seen as augmentation rather than replacement. Many applications benefit from a collaborative approach where AI tools assist human translators in their work, improving efficiency and consistency. The human touch remains crucial for nuanced, accurate, and culturally sensitive translations."

A learning rate that is too large may cause the algorithm to diverge while one that is too small can slow down convergence. Adaptive methods like Adam and RMSprop address this by adjusting the learning rate dynamically during training.\nLong Training Times: While each individual update is fast, the convergence might take a longer time overall since the steps are more erratic compared to batch gradient descent."

    "output": "The advantage of adding this type of skip connection is that if any layer hurt the performance of architecture then it will be skipped by regularization. So, this results in training a very deep neural network without the problems caused by vanishing/exploding gradient.  The authors of the paper experimented on 100-1000 layers of the CIFAR-10 dataset. Learning small adjustments F(x) is much easier for the network, especially when the network is very deep. This makes training faster and avoids problems like gradients becoming too small (vanishing gradient problem).\nThere is a similar approach called \"highway networks\", these networks also use skip connection. Similar to LSTM these skip connections also use parametric gates. These gates determine how much information passes through the skip connection. This architecture however has not provided accuracy better than ResNet architecture.\nNetwork Architecture:This network uses a34-layerplain network architecture inspired byVGG-19in which then the shortcut connection is added. These shortcut connections then convert the architecture into a residual network.\nImplementation:Using the Tensorflow and Keras API, we can design ResNet architecture (including Residual Blocks) from scratch. Below is the implementation of different ResNet architecture.\nFor this implementation, we use theCIFAR-10dataset. This dataset contains 60,000 , 32x32 color images in 10 different classes (airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks), etc. This dataset can be assessed fromkeras.datasetsAPI function.\nStep 1:First, we import the keras module and its APIs. These APIs help in building the architecture of the ResNet model.\nStep 2:Now, We set different training hyper parameters that are required for ResNet architecture. We also perform some preprocessing on our dataset to prepare it for training phase.\nStep 3:In this step, we set the learning rate according to the number of epochs. As the number of epochs the learning rate must bedecreasedto ensure better learning.\nThis function,lr_schedule, adjusts the learning rate based on the current training epoch. It starts with a base learning rate of 0.001 (1e-3). As the number of epochs increases, the learning rate decreases step by step: after 80 epochs, it becomes 0.0001 (10 times smaller), after 120 epochs, it reduces further to 0.00001, and so on.\nThis gradual decrease helps the model make smaller updates to fine-tune its learning as training progresses. The function also prints the current learning rate so you can track how it's changing.\nStep 4:Defining basic ResNet building block that can be used for defining the ResNet V1 and V2 architecture.\nTheresnet_layerfunction creates a ResNet layer with a convolution (Conv2D), optional batch normalization, and activation (e.g., ReLU). The order of these operations depends on theconv_firstflag, making it flexible for building ResNet architectures.\nStep 5:Defining ResNet V1 architecture that is based on the ResNet building block we defined above:\nStep 6:Define ResNet V2 architecture that is based on the ResNet building block we defined above:\nThis code implements ResNet V2, a deep residual network with bottleneck blocks, batch normalization, and ReLU before convolutions. It efficiently downsamples inputs, ending with global average pooling and a softmax classifier for robust training of deep models.\nStep 7:The code below is used totrain and testthe ResNet v1 and v2 architecture we defined above:\nOutput\nThe log shows the model’s training progress over epochs. In each epoch, the training accuracy increases, while validation accuracy stabilizes around 90%. The model’s loss decreases for both training and validation. The learning rate is very low (5.0000e-07), indicating the model is in the fine-tuning phase, making small updates. There’s a slight gap between training and validation accuracy, suggesting potential overfitting."

On COCO object detection dataset, it also generates a28%relative improvement due to its very deep representation.\nThe result above shows that shortcut connections would be able to solve the problem caused by increasing the layers because as we increase layers from 18 to 34 the error rate on ImageNet Validation Set also decreases unlike the plain network.\n\nBelow are the results on ImageNet Test Set. The3.57%top-5 error rate of ResNet was the lowest and thus ResNet architecture came first in ImageNet classification challenge in 2015.\n\nResidual Networks (ResNet) revolutionized deep learning by introducing skip connections, which allow information to bypass layers, making it easier to train very deep networks.

AdaIN operation is defined by the following equation:\nwhere each feature mapxis normalized separately and then scaled and biased using the corresponding scalar components from styley.

    "input": "Understanding the Problem",
    "output": "Traditional image super-resolution methods, such asbilinear interpolationhave drawbacks. They can enlarge image dimensions but often produce overly smooth outputs lacking the fine details of true high-resolution images. This happens because traditional techniques depend on simple mathematical interpolation rather than understanding image structures and patterns.\nThey fail to capture textures and sharp edges accurately.\nThe smoothing effect reduces the perceived quality of the upscaled images.\nThe objective is not only to minimize pixel-wise differences but also to generate images that appear realistic to human viewers."

This setup drives the generator to produce increasingly realistic results."
  },
  {
    "input": "Generator Architecture",
    "output": "The generator employs a residual network (ResNet) architecture instead of traditional deep convolutional networks. This choice is important because residual networks use skip connections that allow gradients to flow more effectively during training, enabling the construction of much deeper networks without the vanishing gradient problem.\nThe generator consists of 16 residual blocks, each containing two convolutional layers with 3×3 kernels and 64 feature maps. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization and Parametric ReLU (PReLU) activation. Unlike standard ReLU or LeakyReLU, PReLU adapts and learns the slope parameter for negative values, providing better performance with minimal computational overhead.\nThe upsampling process uses two trained sub-pixel convolution layers that efficiently increase the spatial resolution. Sub-pixel convolution rearranges elements from the channel dimension to spatial dimensions, effectively performing learned upsampling rather than simple interpolation."

This approach focuses on perceptually important features rather than raw pixel values. The VGG loss can be computed at different network depths:\nVGG2,2:Features from the second convolution layer before the second max-pooling (low-level features)\nVGG5,4:Features from the fourth convolution layer before the fifth max-pooling (high-level features)"

The larger the weight, the bigger the impact size will have on the final result."

Unlike weights, they are not tied to any specific input but instead shift the activation function to better fit the data.\nPurpose: Biases help neurons activate even when the weighted sum of inputs is not enough. This allows the network to recognize patterns that don't necessarily pass through the origin.\nFunctionality: Without biases, neurons would only activate when the input reaches a specific threshold. It makes the network more flexible by enabling activation across a wider range of conditions.\nTraining: During training, biases are updated alongside weights through backpropagation. Together, they fine-tune the model, improving prediction accuracy.\nExample: In a house price prediction network, the bias might ensure that even for a house with a size of zero, the model predicts a non-zero price. This could reflect a fixed value such as land value or other baseline costs."

    "output": "The vanishinggradientproblem is a challenge that emerges during backpropagation when the derivatives or slopes of the activation functions become progressively smaller as we move backward through the layers of a neural network. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in deep networks with many layers, hindering the effective training of the model. The weight updates becomes extremely tiny, or even exponentially small, it can significantly prolong the training time, and in the worst-case scenario, it can halt the training process altogether."
  },
  {
    "input": "Why the Problem Occurs?",
    "output": "During backpropagation, the gradients propagate back through the layers of the network, they decrease significantly. This means that as they leave the output layer and return to the input layer, the gradients become progressively smaller. As a result, the weights associated with the initial levels, which accommodate these small gradients, are updated little or not at each iteration of the optimization process.\nThe vanishing gradient problemis particularly associated with the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent (tanh)activation functionsbecause their derivatives fall within the range of 0 to 0.25 and 0 to 1, respectively. Consequently, extreme weights becomes very small, causing the updated weights to closely resemble the original ones. This persistence of small updates contributes to the vanishing gradient issue.\nThe sigmoid and tanh functions limit the input values ​​to the ranges [0,1] and [-1,1], so that they saturate at 0 or 1 for sigmoid and -1 or 1 for Tanh. The derivatives at points becomes zero as they are moving. In these regions, especially when inputs are very small or large, the gradients are very close to zero. While this may not be a major concern in shallow networks with a few layers, it is a more pronounced issue in deep networks. When the inputs fall in saturated regions, the gradients approach zero, resulting in little update to the weights of the previous layer. In simple networks this does not pose much of a problem, but as more layers are added, these small gradients, which multiply between layers, decay significantly and consequently the first layer tears very slowly , and hinders overall model performance and can lead to convergence failure."

  {
    "input": "How can we identify?",
    "output": "Identifying the vanishing gradient problem typically involves monitoring the training dynamics of a deep neural network.\nOne key indicator is observing model weightsconverging to 0or stagnation in the improvement of the model's performance metrics over training epochs.\nDuring training, if theloss function fails to decreasesignificantly, or if there is erratic behavior in the learning curves, it suggests that the gradients may be vanishing.\nAdditionally, examining the gradients themselves during backpropagation can provide insights.Visualization techniques, such as gradient histograms or norms, can aid in assessing the distribution of gradients throughout the network."
  },
  {
    "input": "How can we solve the issue?",
    "output": "Batch Normalization: Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift. This can help stabilize and accelerate the training process, allowing for more consistent gradient flow.\nActivation function: Activation function likeRectified Linear Unit (ReLU)can be used. WithReLU,the gradient is 0 for negative and zero input, and it is 1 for positive input, which helps alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. Therefore, ReLU operates by replacing poor enter values with 0, and 1 for fine enter values, it preserves the input unchanged.\nSkip Connections and Residual Networks (ResNets): Skip connections, as seen in ResNets, allow the gradient to bypass certain layers during backpropagation. This facilitates the flow of information through the network, preventing gradients from vanishing.\nLong Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): In the context of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), architectures like LSTMs and GRUs are designed to address the vanishing gradient problem in sequences by incorporating gating mechanisms .\nGradient Clipping: Gradient clipping involves imposing a threshold on the gradients during backpropagation.

  },
  {
    "input": "Why Exploding Gradient Occurs?",
    "output": "The issue of exploding gradients arises when, during backpropagation, the derivatives or slopes of the neural network's layers grow progressively larger as we move backward. This is essentially the opposite of the vanishing gradient problem.\nThe root cause of this problem lies in the weights of the network, rather than the choice of activation function. High weight values lead to correspondingly high derivatives, causing significant deviations in new weight values from the previous ones. As a result, the gradient fails to converge and can lead to the network oscillating around local minima, making it challenging to reach the global minimum point.\nIn summary, exploding gradients occur when weight values lead to excessively large derivatives, making convergence difficult and potentially preventing the neural network from effectively learning and optimizing its parameters.\nAs we discussed earlier, the update for the weights during backpropagation in a neural network is given by:\n\\Delta W_i = -\\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial W_i}\nwhere,\nΔW_i: The change in the weightW_i\nα: The learning rate, a hyperparameter that controls the step size of the update.\nL: The loss function that measures the error of the model.\n\\frac{∂L}{∂W_i}: The partial derivative of the loss function with respect to the weightW_i, which indicates the gradient of the loss function with respect to that weight.\nThe exploding gradient problem occurs when the gradients become very large during backpropagation. This is often the result of gradients greater than 1, leading to a rapid increase in values as you propagate them backward through the layers.\nMathematically, the update rule becomes problematic when∣∇W_i∣>1, causing the weights to increase exponentially during training."

    "output": "Identifying the presence of exploding gradients in deep neural network requires careful observation and analysis during training. Here are some key indicators:\nThe loss function exhibits erratic behavior, oscillating wildly instead of steadily decreasing suggesting that the network weights are being updated excessively by large gradients, preventing smooth convergence.\nThe training process encounters \"NaN\" (Not a Number) values in the loss function or other intermediate calculations..\nIf network weights, during training exhibit significant and rapid increases in their values, it suggests the presence of exploding gradients.\nTools like TensorBoard can be used to visualize the gradients flowing through the network."

  },
  {
    "input": "Top-Down Parsing",
    "output": "Top-down parsing is a method of building a parse tree from the start symbol (root) down to the leaves (end symbols). The parser begins with the highest-level rule and works its way down, trying to match the input string step by step.\nProcess: The parser starts with the start symbol and looks for rules that can help it rewrite this symbol. It keeps breaking down the symbols (non-terminals) into smaller parts until it matches the input string.\nLeftmost Derivation: In top-down parsing, the parser always chooses the leftmost non-terminal to expand first, following what is called leftmost derivation. This means the parser works on the left side of the string before moving to the right.\nOther Names: Top-down parsing is sometimes called recursive parsing or predictive parsing. It is called recursive because it often uses recursive functions to process the symbols.\nTop-down parsing is useful for simple languages and is often easier to implement. However, it can have trouble with more complex or ambiguous grammars.\nTop-down parsers can be classified into two types based on whether they use backtracking or not:"

    "input": "2.Top-down Parsing without Backtracking",
    "output": "In this approach, the parser does not backtrack. It tries to find a match with the input using only the first choice it makes, If it doesn’t match the input, it fails immediately instead of going back to try another option.\nExample: The parser will always stick with its first decision and will not reconsider other rules once it starts parsing.\nAdvantage: It is faster because it doesn’t waste time going back to previous steps.\nDisadvantage: It can only handle simpler grammars that don’t require trying multiple choices.\nRead more aboutclassification of top-down parser."

  {
    "input": "Bottom-Up Parsing",
    "output": "Bottom-up parsing is a method of building a parse tree starting from the leaf nodes (the input symbols) and working towards the root node (the start symbol). The goal is to reduce the input string step by step until we reach the start symbol, which represents the entire language.\nProcess: The parser begins with the input symbols and looks for patterns that can be reduced to non-terminals based on the grammar rules. It keeps reducing parts of the string until it forms the start symbol.\nRightmost Derivation in Reverse: In bottom-up parsing, the parser traces the rightmost derivation of the string but works backwards, starting from the input string and moving towards the start symbol.\nShift-Reduce Parsing: Bottom-up parsers are often called shift-reduce parsers because they shift (move symbols) and reduce (apply rules to replace symbols) to build the parse tree.\nBottom-up parsing is efficient for handling more complex grammars and is commonly used in compilers. However, it can be more challenging to implement compared to top-down parsing.\nGenerally,bottom-up parsingis categorized into the following types:\n1. LR parsing/Shift Reduce Parsing:Shift reduce Parsing is a process of parsing a string to obtain the start symbol of the grammar.\nLR(0)\nSLR(1)\nLALR\nCLR\n2. Operator Precedence Parsing:The grammar defined using operator grammar is known as operator precedence parsing.

The rooms are called \"states\", and the different paths you can take between them are called \"transitions\". Each transition has a probability, which is like a chance of moving to the next state.\nSo, let's say there are 3 states or rooms. you're in State 1, and you have to move to State 2 or State 3. If the probability of moving to state 2 is 0.3, and the probability of moving to state 3 is 0.7, it means there's a 30% chance of moving to state 2 and a 70% chance of moving to state 3.\nThe transition probabilities are written in a special table called a \"transition matrix\". This matrix tells you the probability of moving from one state to another. For example, if you're in state 1 and want to move to state 2 or state 3, you would look at the row for state 1 and the columns for state 2 and state 3 to find the probabilities.\nMarkov chains are used to model many things, like weather patterns, stock prices, and even text.

  {
    "input": "Working of NLU: Step-by-Step Breakdown",
    "output": "To understand how Natural Language Understanding processes input, consider the sentence:\n\"A new mobile will be launched in the upcoming year.\"\n1.Text Preprocessing: The first step is to clean and normalize the input. This involves breaking the sentence into individual words (tokenization), removing common stopwords and also reducing words to their root forms (such as converting “launched” to “launch”). This results in a simplified and more meaningful representation of the sentence.Output:At this stage, non-essential elements are removed and the text is transformed into a basic list of meaningful words.\n2.Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Each word is then assigned a grammatical category such as noun, verb or adjective. This helps identify the function of each word in the sentence.Output:POS tagging helps the system understand which words serve as subjects, actions, or descriptors, contributing to sentence structure comprehension.\n3.Named Entity Recognition (NER): In this phase specific types of information like names of products, dates or locations are identified. In the example sentence, “mobile” may be recognized as a product and “upcoming year” as a time reference.Output:NER highlights the most informative parts of the sentence, enabling the system to grasp what and when something is being discussed.\n4.Dependency Parsing: Dependency parsing examines how words are connected. It identifies which words depend on others to convey meaning. For instance, “mobile” depends on “launched,” and “upcoming year” provides a time reference for that action.Output:This parsing shows relationships between words, allowing the system to interpret how the sentence is structured semantically.\n5.Word Sense Ambiguity: Some words can have multiple meanings depending on context. Here, the word “mobile” could refer to a phone or a moving object. By checking the surrounding words like “launched” and “year” the system shows that the sentence is about a product release, specifically a smartphone.Output:This step ensures that words are interpreted correctly based on their usage in context.\n6.Intent Recognition: Intent recognition identifies the purpose behind the input. In this case, the sentence is likely meant to inform about a product launch. Determining intent is particularly important in dialogue systems where understanding user goals is essential.Output:The system categorizes the input under an intent like inform_product_release, guiding appropriate actions or responses.\n7. Output Generation: Once the sentence is understood, the system formulates a suitable response or action. For instance, it might respond with a confirmation or ask for more details, depending on the context of the conversation.Output:A response is produced based on the extracted meaning and recognized intent, which helps to maintain a meaningful interaction."

Dictionary Lookup:Each word or multi-word expression in the input text is checked against the dictionary. If a word or phrase matches an entry in the dictionary, it is extracted as a single token.\n3. Token Matching:If the word or phrase exists in the dictionary, it is grouped as a token.

This can involve:\nSplitting a word into subwords or characters.\nKeeping it as a single token if no dictionary match is found.\nFor example, if a word like \"NLP\" is not in the dictionary, it may be broken into:\n'N' and 'LP' or treated as a special token if predefined in the dictionary.\n5.

    "input": "Need for Punctuation Removal in NLP",
    "output": "InNatural Language Processing (NLP), the removal of punctuation marks is a critical preprocessing step that significantly influences the outcome of various tasks and analyses. This necessity stems from the fact that punctuation, while essential for human readability and comprehension, often adds minimal semantic value when processing text through algorithms. For instance, periods, commas, and question marks do not usually contribute to the understanding of the topic or sentiment of a text, and in many computational tasks, they can be considered noise.\nPunctuation removal simplifies text data, streamlining the analysis by reducing the complexity and variability within the data. For example, in tokenization, where text is split into meaningful elements, punctuation can lead to an inflated number of tokens, some of which may only differ by a punctuation mark (e.g., \"word\" vs. \"word.\"). This unnecessary complexity can hamper the model's ability to learn from the data effectively.\nMoreover, in tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or machine translation, the primary focus is on the words and their arrangements. The presence of punctuation might skew word frequency counts or embeddings, leading to less accurate models. Additionally, for models that rely on word matching, like search engines or chatbots, punctuation can hinder the model's ability to find matches due to discrepancies between the input text and the text in the training set.\nRemoving punctuation also contributes to data uniformity, ensuring that the text is processed in a consistent manner, which is paramount for algorithms to perform optimally. By eliminating these symbols, NLP tasks can proceed more smoothly, focusing on the linguistic elements that contribute more directly to the meaning and sentiment of the text, thereby enhancing the quality and reliability of the outcomes."

    "output": "Efficiency:Regular expressions are powerful and flexible but can be slower on large datasets or complex patterns. For simple punctuation removal, the performance difference might be negligible, but it's important to profile your code if processing large volumes of text.\nAccuracy:While removing punctuation is generally straightforward, using methods like regular expressions allows for more nuanced control over which characters to remove or keep. This can be important in domains where certain punctuation marks carry semantic weight (e.g., financial texts with dollar signs).\nReadability vs. Speed:The RegexpTokenizer approach is more readable and directly suited to NLP tasks but might be slightly less efficient than custom regular expressions or list comprehensions due to its overhead. However, the difference in speed is usually minor compared to the benefits of code clarity and maintainability.\nRemoving punctuation is a foundational step in preprocessing text for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It simplifies the dataset, reducing complexity and allowing models to focus on the semantic content of the text.

The hardware knows a language, that is hard for us to grasp, consequently, we tend to write programs in a high-level language, that is much less complicated for us to comprehend and maintain in our thoughts. Now, these programs go through a series of transformations so that they can readily be used by machines. This is where language procedure systems come in handy.\nPre-Processor:The pre-processor removes all the #include directives by including the files called file inclusion and all the #define directives using macro expansion. It performs file inclusion, augmentation, macro-processing, etc. For example: Let in the source program, it is written #include \"Stdio. h\". Pre-Processor replaces this file with its contents in the produced output.\nAssembler:Assembly Language neither in binary form nor high level. It is an intermediate state that is a combination of machine instructions and some other useful data needed for execution. For every platform (Hardware + OS) we will have an assembler. They are not universal since for each platform we have one. The output of the assembler is called an object file. Its translates assembly language to machine code.\nCompiler:The compiler is an intelligent program as compared to an assembler. The compiler verifies all types of limits, ranges, errors, etc. Compiler program takes more time to run and it occupies a huge amount of memory space. The speed of the compiler is slower than other system software. It takes time because it enters through the program and then does the translation of the full program.\nInterpreter:An interpreter converts high-level language into low-level machine language, just like a compiler. But they are different in the way they read the input. The Compiler in one go reads the inputs, does the processing, and executes the source code whereas the interpreter does the same line by line. A compiler scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine codewhereas an interpretertranslates the program one statement at a time. Interpreted programs are usually slower concerning compiled ones.\nLoader/Linker:Loader/Linkerconverts the relocatable code into absolute code and tries to run the program resulting in a running program or an error message (or sometimes both can happen). Linker loads a variety of object files into a single file to make it executable. Then loader loads it in memory and executes it.Linker:The basic work of a linker is to merge object codes (that have not even been connected), produced by the compiler, assembler, standard library function, and operating system resources.Loader:The codes generated by the compiler, assembler, and linker are generally re-located by their nature, which means to say, the starting location of these codes is not determined, which means they can be anywhere in the computer memory. Thus the basic task of loaders to find/calculate the exact address of these memory locations.\nLinker:The basic work of a linker is to merge object codes (that have not even been connected), produced by the compiler, assembler, standard library function, and operating system resources.\nLoader:The codes generated by the compiler, assembler, and linker are generally re-located by their nature, which means to say, the starting location of these codes is not determined, which means they can be anywhere in the computer memory.

It is capable of creating code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running.\nSource-to-Source Compiler:A Source-to-Source Compiler or transcompiler or transpiler is a compiler that translates source code written in one programming language into the source code of another programming language.\nSingle Pass Compiler:When all the phases of the compiler are present inside a single module, it is simply called a single-pass compiler. It performs the work of converting source code to machine code.\nTwo Pass Compiler:Two-pass compiler is a compiler in which the program is translated twice, once from the front end and the back from the back end known as Two Pass Compiler.\nMulti-Pass Compiler:When several intermediate codes are created in a program and a syntax tree is processed many times, it is called Multi-Pass Compiler. It breaks codes into smaller programs.\nJust-in-Time (JIT) Compiler: It is a type of compiler that converts code into machine language during program execution, rather than before it runs. It combines the benefits of interpretation (real-time execution) and traditional compilation (faster execution).\nAhead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler:It converts the entire source code into machine code before the program runs. This means the code is fully compiled during development, resulting in faster startup times and better performance at runtime.\nIncremental Compiler:It compiles only the parts of the code that have changed, rather than recompiling the entire program. This makes the compilation process faster and more efficient, especially during development."

Context-Free Grammars (CFG)\nContext-Free Grammars define the syntax rules of a programming language. They consist of production rules that describe how valid strings (sequences of tokens) are formed. CFGs are used to specify the grammar of the language, ensuring that the source code adheres to the language's syntax.\n2. Derivations\nA derivation is the process of applying the rules of a Context-Free Grammar to generate a sequence of tokens, ultimately forming a valid structure. It helps in constructing a parse tree, which represents the syntactic structure of the source code.\n3. Concrete and Abstract Syntax Trees\nConcrete Syntax Tree (CST): Represents the full syntactic structure of the source code, including every detail of the grammar.\nAbstract Syntax Tree (AST): A simplified version of the CST, focusing on the essential elements and removing redundant syntax to make it easier for further processing.\n4. Ambiguity\nAmbiguity occurs when a grammar allows multiple interpretations for the same string of tokens. This can lead to errors or inconsistencies in parsing, making it essential to avoid ambiguous grammar in programming languages.\nThese formalisms are crucial for performing accurate syntax analysis and ensuring that the source code follows the correct grammatical structure."

Context-free grammar is a formal language used to describe the structure of programming languages.\nTop-Down and Bottom-Up Parsing:Syntax analysis can be performed using two main approaches: top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing. Top-down parsing starts from the highest level of the syntax tree and works its way down, while bottom-up parsing starts from the lowest level and works its way up.\nError Detection:Syntax analysis is responsible for detecting syntax errors in the code. If the code does not conform to the rules of the programming language, the parser will report an error and halt the compilation process.\nIntermediate Code Generation:Syntax analysis generates an intermediate representation of the code, which is used by the subsequent phases of the compiler. The intermediate representation is usually a more abstract form of the code, which is easier to work with than the original source code.\nOptimization:Syntax analysis can perform basic optimizations on the code, such as removing redundant code and simplifying expressions."

It uses the given production rules and applies those as needed to generate the string. To generate string “cad” it uses the rules as shown in the given diagram:\nIn step (iii) above, the production rule A->bc was not a suitable one to apply (because the string produced is “cbcd” not “cad”), here the parser needs to backtrack, and apply the next production rule available with A which is shown in step (iv), and the string “cad” is produced.\nThus, the given input can be produced by the given grammar, therefore the input is correct in syntax.

Decoder Self-Attention: In the decoder, self-attention ensures that each position in the output sequence can attend only to previous positions (with a masking mechanism), preventing the decoder from “seeing” future tokens during training. This helps in generating sequences in an autoregressive manner while focusing on relevant parts of what has been generated so far.\n3. Encoder-Decoder Attention: This layer lets the decoder attend over the encoder's output. It helps the decoder to align and focus on the appropriate input tokens when generating each output token, enabling sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation."

Limitations are as follows:\nIgnores the order of words in the document: Causes loss of sequential information and context\nSparse representations make it Memory intensive: Many elements are zero resulting in Computational inefficiency with large datasets.\nOutput:\n1.3 Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)\nTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, commonly known as TF-IDF, is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is widely used in natural language processing and information retrieval to evaluate the significance of a term within a specific document in a larger corpus. TF-IDF consists of two components:\nTerm Frequency (TF):Measures how often a term (word) appears in a document.\nInverse Document Frequency (IDF):Measures the importance of a term across a collection of documents.\nThe TF-IDF score for a term t in a document d is then given by multiplying the TF and IDF values:\nWhere:\nTerm Frequency (TF):\\text{TF}(t,d) = \\frac{\\text{Total number of times term } t \\text{ appears in document } d}{\\text{Total number of terms in document } d}\nInverse Document Frequency (IDF):\\text{IDF}(t,D) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{Total documents }}{\\text{Number of documents containing term t}}\\right)\nThe higher the TF-IDF score for a term in a document, the more important that term is to that document within the context of the entire corpus. This weighting scheme helps in identifying and extracting relevant information from a large collection of documents, and it is commonly used in text mining, information retrieval, and document clustering.\nSteps are as follows:\nDefine a set of sample documents.\nUse TfidfVectorizer to transform these documents into a TF-IDF matrix.\nExtract and print the TF-IDF values for each word in each document.\nThis statistical measure helps assess the importance of words in a document relative to their frequency across a collection of documents,\nHelps in information retrieval and text analysis tasks.\nOutput:\nSome of the disadvantages of TF-IDF are:\nInability in Capturing context: Doesn't consider semantic relationships in words.\nSensitivity to Document Length: Longer documents have higher overall term frequencies, potentially biasing TF-IDF towards longer documents."

It belongs to the family of neural word embedding techniques and specifically falls under the category of distributed representation models. It is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP).\nRepresent words as continuous vector spaces.\nAim: Capture the semantic relationships between words by mapping them to high-dimensional vectors.\nWords with similar meanings should have similar vector representations. Every word is assigned a vector. We start with either a random orone-hot vector.\nThere are two neural embedding methods for Word2Vec: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram.\n2.2 Continuous Bag of Words(CBOW)\nContinuous Bag of Words (CBOW)is a type of neural network architecture used in the Word2Vec model. The primary objective of CBOW is to predict a target word based on its context, which consists of the surrounding words in a given window. Given a sequence of words in a context window, the model is trained to predict the target word at the center of the window.\nFeedforward neural network with a single hidden layer.\nThe input layer, hidden layer, and output layer represent the context words, learned continuous vectors or embeddings, and the target word.\nUseful for learning distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space.\n\nThe hidden layer contains the continuous vector representations (word embeddings) of the input words.\nThe weights between the input layer and the hidden layer are learned during training.\nThe dimensionality of the hidden layer represents the size of the word embeddings (the continuous vector space).\nOutput:\n2.3 Skip-Gram\nThe Skip-Gram modellearns distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space. The main objective of Skip-Gram is to predict context words (words surrounding a target word) given a target word. This is the opposite of the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) model, where the objective is to predict the target word based on its context. It is shown that this method produces more meaningful embeddings.\n\nOutput: Trained vectors of each word after many iterations through the corpus.\nPreserve syntactical or semantic information, Converted to lower dimensions.\nSimilar meaning (semantic info) vectors are placed close to each other in space.\nvector_size parameter controls the dimensionality of the word vectors, and you can adjust other parameters such as window.\nOutput:\nThe choice between CBOW and Skip-gram depends on data and the task.\nCBOW might be preferred when training resources are limited, and capturing syntactic information is important.\nSkip-gram is chosen when semantic relationships and the representation of rare words are important."

It leverages the global context to create word embeddings that reflect the overall meaning of words based on their co-occurrence probabilities. this method, we take the corpus and iterate through it and get the co-occurrence of each word with other words in the corpus. We get a co-occurrence matrix through this. The words which occur next to each other get a value of 1, if they are one word apart then 1/2, if two words apart then 1/3 and so on.\nLet's see how the matrix is created. Corpus:\nThe upper half of the matrix will be a reflection of the lower half. We can consider a window frame as well to calculate the co-occurrences by shifting the frame till the end of the corpus. This helps gather information about the context in which the word is used.\nVectors for each word is assigned randomly.\nTake two pairs of vectors and see closeness in space.\nIf they occur together more often or have a higher value in the co-occurrence matrix and are far apart in space then they are brought close to each other.\nIf they are close to each other but are rarely or not frequently used together then they are moved further apart in space.\nOutput: Vector space representation that approximates the information from the co-occurrence matrix.\nOutput:\n3.2 Fasttext\nDeveloped by Facebook,FastTextextends Word2Vec by representing words as bags of character n-grams. This approach is particularly useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words and capturing morphological variations.\nOutput:\n3.3 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\nBERTis a transformer-based model that learns contextualized embeddings for words.

The lexical analyzer does not generate all tokens at once but provides them on request.\nIn the first phase, the compiler doesn't check the syntax. So, here this program as input to the lexical analyzer and convert it into the tokens. So, tokenization is one of the important functioning of lexical analyzer. The total number of token for this program is 26. Below given is the diagram of how it will count the token.In this above diagram, you can check and count the number of tokens and can understand how tokenization works in lexical analyzer phase.

    "input": "Role of Lexical Analyzer",
    "output": "Clean up the source code:Source code often contains extra characters that the compiler or interpreter doesn't need, like spaces, tabs, newlines, and comments.  The lexical analyzer removes these to make the next stage of processing easier.  Think of it like cleaning up your desk before starting a project.\nKeep track of errors:While cleaning up, the lexical analyzer might encounter invalid characters or sequences of characters that don't form a valid token.  For example, it might find a character that's not allowed in the programming language.  When this happens, it reports an error message and ideally pinpoints the location of the error in the original source code (e.g., line number and character position). This helps programmers find and fix mistakes.\nFigure out the basic building blocks (tokens):This is the core job. The lexical analyzer scans the cleaned-up source code and groups characters together into meaningful units calledtokens.  These tokens are the fundamental building blocks of the program.  Examples of tokens include: The lexical analyzer doesn't understand themeaningof these tokens; it just identifies what they are.\nKeywords:if,else,while,for,int,float, etc. (reserved words with special meanings)\nIdentifiers:Variable names, function names, etc. (user-defined names)\nOperators:+,-,*,/,=,==,<,>, etc. (symbols that perform operations)\nLiterals:Numbers (e.g.,10,3.14), strings (e.g.,\"hello\"), boolean values (true,false), etc. (represent constant values)\nPunctuation:;,,,(,),{,}, etc. (used for structure and grouping)\nRead the source code character by character:The lexical analyzer reads the source code one character at a time, grouping these characters into tokens.  It's like reading a sentence word by word, but at a more fundamental level – character by character to form the words (tokens).  This character-by-character reading allows it to recognize even complex tokens."

The importance of an information extraction system is determined by the growing amount of information available in unstructured form(data without metadata), like on the Internet. This knowledge can be made more accessible utilizing transformation into relational form, or by marking-up with XML tags.\nWe always try to use automated learning systems in information extraction and we always use this. This type of IE system will decrease the faults in information extraction. This will also reduce dependencies on a domain by diminishing the requirement for supervision. IE of structured information relies on the basic content management principle: \"Content must be in context to have value\". Information Extraction is difficult than Information Retrieval."

    "input": "Difference between Information Retrieval and Information Extraction",
    "output": "Information Extraction is not Information Retrieval. Conventional text extraction methods also return a set of a subset of documents that are probably relevant to the query. Result return is based on search keywords.The main goal of IE is to extract meaningful information from corps of documents that might be in different languages. Here meaningful information contains types of information like events, facts, components, or relations. These facts are then usually stored automatically into a database, which may then be used to analyze the data for trends, to give a natural language summary, or simply to serve for online access. More formally, Information Extraction gets facts out of documents while Information Retrieval gets sets of relevant documents."

The vectors are learned in such a way that similar documents are mapped to nearby points in the vector space.

The basic idea behind Distributed Memory is to learn a fixed-length vector representation for each piece of text data (such as a sentence, paragraph, or document) by taking into account the context in which it appears.\nIn the DM architecture, the neural network takes two types of inputs:  the context words and a unique document ID. The context words are used to predict a target word, and the document ID is used to capture the overall meaning of the document. The network has two main components:  the projection layer and the output layer.\nThe projection layer is responsible for creating the word vectors and document vectors. For each word in the input sequence, a unique word vector is created, and for each document, a unique document vector is created. These vectors are learned through the training process by optimizing a loss function that minimizes the difference between the predicted word and the actual target word. The output neural network takes the distributed representation of the context and predicts the target word."

But BERT has a bidirectionality feature that enables to processing of the text from both directions i.e. left to right and right to left. For this feature, BERT can effectively analyze the context of each word by considering all the words in the sentence.\nPre-training and Fine-tuning:BERT is capable of learning rich and contextualized word representations as it is pre-trained on a massive corpus of text data. And we can perform fine-tuning on this pre-trained data as per our requirement which makes BERT highly adaptable and effective for various NLP tasks.\nMulti-Layer Stacking:BERT consists of stacked transformers i.e. it has multiple layers of transformers stacked on top of each other. This feature enables BERT to capture more complex contextual information.\nEmbedding Layers:BERT utilizes Word Piece tokenization where each word of the input sentence breaks down into sub-word tokens.\nMasked Language Modeling (MLM):BERT is also trained to predict masked words within a sentence.

SEP special token is used for separating different segments or sentences within a single input sequence. It is also should be inserted between two sentences or segments.

Adding special tokens is a good practice when working with word Embeddings.\nOutput:\nSo, for each token attention is 1 so,  overall attention score is 1 which denotes that out BERT model is considering the entire input sequence to generate the embeddings for each token.

Instead of treating \"unbreakable\" as a single unknown token, it breaks it down into recognizable pieces: [\"un\", \"##break\", \"##able\"]. The \"##\" prefix indicates that a token continues from the previous piece, preserving word boundaries and also enabling flexible decomposition.\nThis approach ensures that even completely new words can be understood through their constituent parts which results in improving model robustness and generalization."

Is it in a machine-readable format? if in the machine-readable format then will it be relevant to our problem? So, First thing we need to understand our problem or task then we should search for data. Here we will see some of the ways of collecting data if it is not available in our local machine or database.\nPublic Dataset:We can search for publicly available data as per our problem statement.\nWeb Scrapping:Web Scrapping is a technique to scrap data from a website. For this, we can use Beautiful Soup to scrape the text data from the web page.\nImage to Text:  We can also scrap the data from the image files with the help of  Optical character recognition (OCR). There is a library Tesseract that uses OCR to convert image to text data.\npdf to Text:  We have multiple Python packages to convert the data into text. With the PyPDF2 library, pdf data can be extracted in the .text file.\nData augmentation: if our acquired data is not very sufficient for our problem statement then we can generate fake data from the existing data by Synonym replacement, Back Translation, Bigram flipping, or Adding some noise in data.

So, first, we need to Tokenize our text data.\nTokenization:Tokenization is the process of segmenting the text into a list of tokens. In the case of sentence tokenization, the token will be sentenced and in the case of word tokenization, it will be the word. It is a good idea to first complete sentence tokenization and then word tokenization, here output will be the list of lists. Tokenization is performed in each & every NLP pipeline.\nLowercasing:This step is used to convert all the text to lowercase letters. This is useful in various NLP tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis.\nStop word removal:Stop words are commonly occurring words in a language such as \"the\", \"and\", \"a\", etc. They are usually removed from the text during preprocessing because they do not carry much meaning and can cause noise in the data. This step is used in various NLP tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and topic modeling.\nStemming or lemmatization:Stemming and lemmatization are used to reduce words to their base form, which can help reduce the vocabulary size and simplify the text. Stemming involves stripping the suffixes from words to get their stem, whereas lemmatization involves reducing words to their base form based on their part of speech. This step is commonly used in various NLP tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and topic modeling.\nRemoving digit/punctuation:This step is used to remove digits and punctuation from the text. This is useful in various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\nPOS tagging:POS tagging involves assigning a part of speech tag to each word in a text. This step is commonly used in various NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER):NER involves identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.

So, when the vocabulary is large then the feature size will become very large. So, this makes it tough for the ML model.\nOne Hot Encodingrepresents each token as a binary vector. First mapped each token to integer values. and then each integer value is represented as a binary vector where all values are 0 except the index of the integer. index of the integer is marked by 1.\nOutput:\nAbag of wordsonly describes the occurrence of words within a document or not.

Bag of n-gram tries to solve this problem by breaking text into chunks of n continuous words.\nOutput:\nThe output shows that the input text has been tokenized into sentences and processed to remove any periods and convert to lowercase. The vectorizer then computes the Bag of n-grams representation of each sentence, and the vocabulary used by the vectorizer is printed. Finally, the n-gram representation of a new text is computed and printed. The n-gram representations are in the form of a sparse matrix, where each row represents a sentence and each column represents an n-gram in the vocabulary. The values in the matrix indicate the frequency of the corresponding n-gram in the sentence.\nIn all the above techniques,  Each word is treated equally.TF-IDFtries to quantify the importance of a given word relative to the other word in the corpus.  it is mainly used in Information retrieval.\nTerm Frequency (TF):TF measures how often a word occurs in the given document. it is the ratio of the number of occurrences of a term or word (t ) in a given document (d) to the total number of terms in a given document (d).\n\\text{TF}(t,d) = \\frac{\\text{(Number of occurrences of term t in document d)}} {\\text{(Total number of terms in the document d)}}\nInverse document frequency (IDF):IDF measures the importance of the word across the corpus. it down the weight of the terms, which commonly occur in the corpus, and up the weight of rare terms.\n\\text{IDF}(t)= \\log_{e}\\frac{\\text{(Total number of documents in the corpus)}} {\\text{(Number of documents with term t in corpus)}}\nTF-IDF score is the product of TF  and IDF.\n\\text{TF-IDF Score} = TF\\;\\times \\;IDF\nOutput:"

It attempts to find the best hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes while maximizing the margin between the hyperplane and the closest data points.

In the context of NLP, HMM is often used for speech recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. HMM assumes that the state transitions are dependent only on the current state and the observation is dependent only on the current state.\nConditional Random Fields:CRF is a type of probabilistic graphical model used for modeling sequential data where the output is a sequence of labels. It is similar to HMM, but unlike HMM, CRF can take into account more complex dependencies between the output labels.

    "output": "Recurrent neural networksare a particular class of artificial neural networks that are created with the goal of processing sequential or time series data. It is primarily used for natural language processing activities including language translation, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, natural language production, summary writing, etc. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs include a loop or cycle built into their architecture that acts as a \"memory\" to hold onto information over time. This distinguishes them from feedforward neural networks. This enables the RNN to process data from sources like natural languages, where context is crucial.\nThe basic concept of RNNs is that they analyze input sequences one element at a time while maintaining track in a hidden state that contains a summary of the sequence’s previous elements. The hidden state is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.  This allows RNNs to capture the temporal dependencies between elements of the sequence and use that information to make predictions.\nWorking: The fundamental component of an RNN is the recurrent neuron, which receives as inputs the current input vector and the previous hidden state and generates a new hidden state as output. And this output hidden state is then used as the input for the next recurrent neuron in the sequence. An RNN can be expressed mathematically as a sequence of equations that update the hidden state at each time step:\nWhere,\nSt= Current state at time t\nxt= Input vector at time t\nSt-1= Previous state at time t-1\nU = Weight matrix of recurrent neuron for the previous state\nW = Weight matrix of input neuron\nb = Bias added to the input vector and previous hidden state\nf = Activation functions\nAnd the output of the RNN at each time step will be:\nWhere,\nyt= Output at time t\nV = Weight matrix for the current state in the output layer\nC = Bias for the output transformations.\ng = activation function\nHere, W, U, V, b, and c are the learnable parameters and it is optimized during the backpropagation.\nModels have to process a large number of tokens. When it is processing a distant token from the first token, The significance of the first token starts decreasing, So, it fails to relate with starting token to the distant token. This can be avoided with explicit state management by using gates.\nThere are two architectures that try to solve this problem.\nLong short-term memory (LSTM)\nGated relay unit (GRU)\nLong Short-Term Memory Networksare an advanced form of RNN model, and it handles the vanishing gradient problem of RNN. It only remembers the part of the context which has a meaningful role in predicting the output value. LSTMs function by selectively passing or retaining information from one-time step to the next using the combination of memory cells and gating mechanisms.\nThe LSTM cell is made up of a number of parts, such as:\nCell state (C):The LSTM's memory component is where the information from the preceding phase is stored at this time.  Gates that regulate the flow of data into and out of the LSTM cell are used to pass it through.\nHidden state (h):This is the LSTM cell's output, which is a modified representation of the cell state.  It may be applied to predictions or transferred to a subsequent LSTM cell in the sequence.\nForget gate (f):The forget gate removes the data that is no longer relevant in the cell state. The gate receives two inputs, xt(input at the current time) and ht-1(previous hidden state), which are multiplied with weight matrices, and bias is added. The result is passed via an activation function, which gives a binary output i.e. True or False.\nInput Gate(i):The input gate determines what parts of the input should be added to the cell state by applying a sigmoid activation function to the current input and the previous concealed state as inputs. The new values that are added to the cell state are created by multiplying the output of the input gate (again, a fraction between 0 and 1) by the output of the tanh block. The current cell state is created by adding this gated vector to the previous cell state.\nOutput Gate(o):The output gate takes the crucial data and outputs it from the state of the current cell.  First, a vector is created in the cell using the tanh function. The data is then filtered by the values to be remembered using the inputs ht-1 and xt, and the information is then controlled using the sigmoid function. The vector's values and the controlled values are finally multiplied and supplied as input and output to the following cell, respectively.The two-state vector for LSTM represents the current state.\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU)is also the advanced form of RNN. which solves the vanishing gradient problem. Like LSTMs, GRUs also have gating mechanisms that allow them to selectively update or forget information from the previous time steps. However, GRUs have fewer parameters than LSTMs, which makes them faster to train and less prone to overfitting. The two gates in GRUs are the reset gate and the update gate, which control the flow of information in the network.\nUpdate Gate:this controls the amount of information passed through the next state.\nRest Gate:It decides whether the previous cell state is important or not."

The process involves annotating a training corpus with both entities and their corresponding relations. The focus is on identifying pairs of named entities, typically found within the same sentence. Following this, a relation classification step is applied to each entity pair.\nFor the classification task, a diverse set of supervised techniques can be employed, ranging from traditional methods like logistic regression and random forest to more advanced models such asrecurrent neural networks (RNNs),transformers, or neural classifiers. The primary objective is to leverage the annotated texts in the training corpus to teach the classifier to recognize and categorize relationships between pairs of named entities.\nUnsupervised relation extraction, often referred to as Open Information Extraction (Open IE), aims to identify relationships in text without the availability of labeled training data or predefined lists of relations.

    "input": "Overview on Statistical Machine Translation in Artificial Intelligence",
    "output": "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) works by analyzing large bilingual corpora, such as parallel texts or sentence-aligned translation pairs, to identify patterns and relationships between words and phrases in different languages. These patterns are then used to build probabilistic models that can generate translations for new sentences or documents.\nGiven the complexity of translation, it is not surprising that the most effective machine translation systems are developed by training a probabilistic model on statistics derived from a vast corpus of text. This method does not require a complicated ontology of interlingua concepts, handcrafted source and target language grammars, or a manually labeled treebank. Instead, it simply requires data in the form of example translations from which a translation model can be learned.\nTo formalize this, SMT determines the translationf^*that maximizes the conditional probabilityP(f \\mid e), where:\nfis the translation (in the target language),\neis the original sentence (in the source language),\nP(f \\mid e)is the probability of the translationfgiven the sentencee.\nThe goal is to find the string of wordsf^*that maximizes this probability:\nf^* = \\underset{f}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\ P(f \\mid e)\nUsingBayes' theorem,this can be rewritten as:\nf^* = \\underset{f}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\ P(e \\mid f) \\cdot P(f)\nHere:\nP(e \\mid f)represents the translation model, which gives the probability of the source sentence given the target translation.\nP(f)is the language model, which estimates the probability of the target sentence being grammatically correct and fluent.\nIn summary, SMT involves finding the translationf^*that maximizes the product of the language model and the translation model, leveraging a large amount of bilingual data to automatically learn the translation process."

    "output": "To explain SMT in action, consider the task of translating a sentence from English (e) to French (f). The translation model, represented asP(f|e), helps determine the probability of a French sentence given its English counterpart. SMT often employs Bayes' rule to utilize the reverse modelP(e|f)P(f), which helps break down complex sentences into manageable components, eventually translating them into coherent phrases in the target language.\nThe language modelP(f)helps define how likely a given sentence is in French, while the translation modelP(e|f)defines how likely an English sentence is to translate into a French sentence. This bilingual corpus-based approach allows SMT to handle vast linguistic structures and provide accurate translations.\n\n\nThe language model,P(f), might address any level(s) on the right-hand side of the figure above, but the simplest and most frequent technique, as we've seen before, is to develop an n-gram model from a French corpus. This just catches a partial, local sense of French phrases, but it's typically enough for a rudimentary translation."

However, in real-world applications, resources are limited, and most sentences encountered during translation are new. Fortunately, many of these sentences are composed of terms or phrases seen before, even if they are as short as one word.\nFor instance, phrases like \"in this exercise we shall,\" \"size of the state space,\" \"as a function of,\" and \"notes at the conclusion of the chapter\" are common.\nGiven the sentence:\"In this exercise, we will compute the size of the state space as a function of the number of actions,\"\nSMT can break it down into phrases, identify corresponding English and French equivalents from the corpus, and then reorder them in a way that makes sense in French."

This formula allows us to calculate the probabilityP(f, d \\mid e)for a given translationfand distortiond.

Text Representation:\nBefore applying logistic regression text data should be converted as numerical features known astext vectorization.\nCommon techniques for text vectorization includeBag of Words (BoW),Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or more advanced methods like word embeddings (Word2Vec,GloVe) or deep learning-based embeddings.\n2. Feature Extraction:\nOnce data is represented numerically, these representations can be used as features for model.\nFeatures could be the counts of words in BoW, the weighted values in TF-IDF, or the numerical vectors in embeddings.\n3. Logistic Regression Model:\nLogistic Regression models the relationship between the features and the probability of belonging to a particular class using the logistic function.\nThe logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) maps any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which is suitable for representing probabilities.\nThe logistic regression model calculates a weighted sum of the input features and applies the logistic function to obtain the probability of belonging to the positive class."

Various tokenization methods exist, ranging from simple whitespace or punctuation-based tokenization to more sophisticated approaches like subword tokenization.\nIn recent years, subword tokenization has gained popularity due to its ability to balance vocabulary size and model performance. Subword tokenization breaks down words into smaller units, allowing models to represent rare or unseen words as combinations of known subwords. SentencePiece is a commonly used library that implements subword tokenization using techniques like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and the Unigram Language Model. After learning a fixed-size vocabulary of subwords from training data, SentencePiece tokenizes new text consistently and efficiently."

This makes it highly adaptable to different languages and text domains.\nThe library offers two primary algorithms for subword tokenization:\nBPE iteratively combines the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords to build a vocabulary, while the Unigram Language Model selects subwords based on their likelihood in the training data. These algorithms enable SentencePiece to efficiently capture both common and rare word patterns, providing a robust solution for tokenization tasks."

This step is essential in NLP as it converts text into numerical representations that machine learning models can interpret.\nOne significant advantage of encoding with SentencePiece is its ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words seamlessly. By breaking down words into subword units, SentencePiece ensures that even words not encountered during training can be represented using known subwords.

  {
    "input": "Deep Learning",
    "output": "So now what exactly is Deep Learning? But before we go and understand what is Deep Learning, let's quickly walk you through the chronology over here, starting off with AI. AI or artificial intelligence is basically the entire thing. AI is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligence within the machine to work and react like human beings. In short, here, we are trying to have the capability of machines to imitate the intelligence of human behaviour. Then we have Machine Learning. ML is basically a science of getting computers to act by feeding them up on previous data. So Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning. And here we make use of something called neural networks. We see neural networks are the set of algorithms and techniques, which are modelled in accordance with the human brain and neural networks are designed to solve complex and advanced machine learning problems.\nSo what exactly is Deep Learning? Well, Deep Learning is a part of a broad family of ML methods, which are based on learning data patterns in opposition to what a Machine Learning algorithm does. In Machine Learning we have algorithms for a specific task. Here, the Deep Learning algorithm can be supervised semi-supervised or unsupervised. As mentioned earlier, Deep Learning is inspired by the human brain and how it perceives information through the interaction of neurons. So let's see what exactly can we do with Deep Learning. But before we go there, so why should we choose deep Learning for, you know, various tasks? So the big advantage of using Deep Learning is that we can extract more features and when we have more features and when we can work at the same time with a huge amount of data, we can perceive an object like a human being does. What it means is, if you want to perform a classification task between pen and a pencil, you'll obviously know as a human being, you know, the difference because you look at a pen and a pencil contains a number of times, and now when you're trying to actually classify it, you can do it with ease. And the reason for this is because, you know, the features of a pen, and you know, the features of a pencil. Similarly, this is how Deep Learning works. More, the data you feed more, the dimensions, it can analyze more the dimensions, it can learn. As already mentioned, one of the most popular applications of Deep Learning is image classification. And when it comes to image classification, it can be something as simple as classifying between two different animals, for something as complicated as, hiding data or trying to run automated cars using classification task.\nSo next type of application using Deep Learning is using Sequential Data. Sequential Data, basically refers to something like time-series data or having to understand natural language. So the reason why we call it sequential data is that here the previous word or the previous feature is dependent upon the next feature. If I say what time is it? So if I just say 'it is' like, over here what time is and, it basically features in the sentence. And in order for you to make an analogy or to understand, obviously have to know what has happened in the past. So in order to do this, we use something called as RNNs. And there are various versions of RNN.\nMoving on to the next application that is GAN's. GANs, which stands for generative adversarial networks is an unsupervised part of a Deep Learning application. Some common application, which you can see in recent days is nothing but deep fakes and many more. Finally, coming down to performance classification and regression task using multi-layer perceptron. If you remember, or if you are well versed with Machine Learning in order to perform classification in ML, we had algorithms like decision tree, random forest, or something, very simple as linear regression or logistic regression. But when we try to perform classification using MLP or multi-layer perceptron, we get a very high accuracy even compared to SVM and decision trees."

  {
    "input": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) Using RNN",
    "output": "So now that we know what exactly is Deep Learning and why we use it, let's now stream down to understand how can we process natural language, data using RNNs. So what are RNNs? It Stands for Recurrent Neural Network. And we usually use this in order to deal with sequential data. Sequential data can be something like a time-seriessome data, or textual data of any format. So why should one use RNN? This is because there's a concept of internal memoriam here. RNN can remember important things about the input it has received, which allows them to be very precise in predicting what can be the next outcome. So this is the reason why they are performed or preferred on a sequential data algorithm. And some of the examples of sequence data can be something like time, series, speech, text, financial data, audio, video, weather, and many more. Although RNN was the state-of-the-art algorithm for dealing with sequential data, they come up with their own drawbacks and some popular drawbacks over here can be like due to the complication or the complexity of the algorithm. The neural network is pretty slow to train. And as a huge amount of dimensions here, the training is very long and difficult to do. Apart from that most decisive feature for RNN or for the improvement in RNN, is that off of vanishing gradient? What this vanished gradient is? When we go deeper and deeper into our neural network, the previous data is lost. This is because of a concept, vanishing ingredient. And you do this we cannot work on a large or longer sequence of data.\nTo overcome this, we came up with some new or upgrades to the current record neural networks or RNNs. Starting off with a Bi-Directional recurrent neural network. Bi-directional recurrent neural network connects two hidden layers of opposite direction into the same output with this form of generating Deep Learning, the output can get information from past and future state simultaneously. So why do we need a Bi-Directional recurrent neural network? Well, it duplicates, RNN processing chain, so that the input process both forward and reverse time order, thus allowing a bi-directional recurrent neural network to look into future context as well. The next one is long short-term memory, long short term memory, or also sometimes referred to as LSTM is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of Deep Learning. This standard feedforward neural network at LSTM has a feedback connection. It can not only process single data point, but also the entire sequence of data. With LSTM or long short term memory, it has something like, you know, we can feed a longer sequence compared to what it was with bi-directional RNN or RNNs.\nSo why is LSTM better than RNN? We can say that when we move from RNN to LSTM, we are introducing more and more control over the sequence of the data that we can provide. Thus, LSTM gives us more control ability and does better results.\nSo the next type of recurrent neural network is the Gated Recurrent Neural Network also referred to as GRUs. It is a type of recurrent neural network that is in certain cases is advantageous over long short-term memory. GRU makes use of less memory and also is faster than LSTM. But the thing is LSTMs are more accurate while using longer datasets. So the trend over here is, you know, the models should be capable of remembering and taking it on a longer input sequence."

So let's take a look at this. The paper 'Attention Is All You Need' introduces and an architecture called last Transformers. Like LSTMs Transformers is an architecture for transforming one sequence into an antidote while helping other two parts that is encoders and decoders, but it differs from the previously described sequence your sequence model, because it does not work like GRUs. So it does not implement recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural network until now was one of the best ways to capture the tiny dependence on a sequence. However, the team presenting this paper that is 'Attention Is All You Need' prove that architecture with only attention mechanism does not use RNN can improve its result in translation task and other NLP tasks. An example of it could be Google's BERT.\nSo what exactly is this transformer. Both encoder and decoder are comprised of modules that can speak onto the top of each other multiple times. So what happens is the inputs and outputs are first embedded into n-dimension space, since we cannot use this directly. So we obviously have to encode our inputs, whatever we are providing. One slight, but important part of this model is positional and coding of different words. Since we have no recurrent neural network that can remember how to sequence is fed into the model, we need to somehow give every word or part of a sequence, a relative position since a sequence depends on the order of the elements. These positions are added to the embedded representation of each word. So this was a brief about Transformers."

Language models are evaluated based on perplexity metrics, which measure how well the model predicts a given sequence. Lower perplexity indicates better performance.\nThe utilization of transformers for language modelling has emerged as a critical element in the field of natural language processing, empowering models to comprehend and produce text that closely resembles human language.\nFor language modelling, Transformers are currently implemented with a fixed-length context, i.e. a long text sequence is truncated into fixed-length segments of a few hundred tokens, and each segment is processed separately.

    "input": "Segment-level recurrent mechanism",
    "output": "In a standard Transformer, the hidden state at a given position is a vector that encodes information about the token at that position and its relationships with other tokens in the sequence. The hidden state is updated through self-attention mechanisms and feedforward layers in each layer of the Transformer.\nThe segment-level recurrent mechanism involves updating the hidden states not only within the current segment but also by attending to the hidden states from previous segments. This enables the model to extend its context window beyond the current segment. Let us understand this mathematically,\nLet,\nSτand Sτ+1be two segments\nL be the length of sequence\nD be the hidden dimension of the layer\nn be the number of layers\nNow the hidden state being feed into nth layer of segment Sτ+1depends not only the hidden state of Sτ+1at n-1 but also the hidden state of layer n-1 at Sτ. The two hidden state vectors are concatenated along the length dimension. This is expressed as\nh^{\\sim n-1}_{\\tau+1} = [SGh^{n-1}_{\\tau} \\oplus SGh^{n-1}_{\\tau +1} ]\nHere we take the hidden state from previous layer of same segment and hidden state from previous layer of last segment and concatenate its. The SG denotes that the gradient is not backpropagated through previous layer.\nThis modified hidden state is used in for key and value calculation to key QKV matrices.\nq^n_{\\tau+1} = h^{n-1}_{\\tau+1}W_q\nk^n_{\\tau+1} = h^{\\sim n-1}_{\\tau+1}W_k^T\nv^n_{\\tau+1} = h^{\\sim n-1}_{\\tau+1}W_v^T\nNote that modified hidden state is used only for K and V. The Query calculation remains dependent only on hidden state of current segment previous layer. The gradient remains within a segment, but the additional history allows the network to model long-term dependency and avoid context fragmentation.\nWith this recurrence mechanism applied to every two consecutive segments of a corpus, it essentially creates a segment-level recurrence in the hidden states. Notice that the recurrent dependency between hnτ+1and hn−1τshifts one layer downwards per segment. This can be visualized as below:\nRelative Positional Encoding\nIn the original transformer paper, we add the positional encoding vector (U) with the embedding vector(E). We multiply the result of this with weight matrices Wqand Wkto get the Q and K vectors.\nThe attention score between i and j token is obtained by multiplying the Query of ithvector with Key of jthvector.\nThis attention score between two tokens at position i and j from the original transformer architecture can be mathematically decomposed into U and E vectors as below.\nA_{ij} = E_{x_i} ^ T W_q^TW_kE_{x_j} + \nE_{x_i} ^ T W_q^TW_kU_{j} + \nU_{i} ^ T W_q^TW_kE_{x_j} +\nU_{i} ^ T W_q^TW_kU_{j}\nHere:\nAij -Is the attention score between words at position i and j\nExi and Exj are the embedding vectors for word at i and j\nUi and Uj are the positional encoding vectors at position i and j\nWq and Wk are the query and key matrix\nThe attention score in transformer XL architecture can mathematically be formulated as below:\nA_{ij} = E_{x_i} ^ T W_q^TW_kE_{x_j} + \nE_{x_i} ^ T W_q^TW_kR_{i-j} + \nu^T W_{k,E}E_{x_j} +\nv^T W_{K,R}U_{j}\nThe four terms can be intuitively understood as:"

    "output": "FastText offers a significant advantage over traditional word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe, especially for morphologically rich languages. Here's a breakdown of how FastText addresses the limitations of traditional word embeddings and its implications:\nUtilization of Character-Level Information: FastText takes advantage of character-level information by representing words as the average of embeddings their character n-grams. This approach allows FastText to capture the internal structure of words, including prefixes, suffixes, and roots, which is particularly beneficial for morphologically rich languages where word formations follow specific rules.\nExtension of Word2Vec Model:FastText is an extension of the Word2Vec model, which means inherits the advantages of Word2Vec, such as capturing semantic relationships between words and producing dense vector representations.\nHandling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: One significant limitation of traditional word embeddings is their inability to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words—words that are not present in the training data or vocabulary. Since Word2Vec and GloVe provide embeddings only for words seen during training, encountering an OOV word during inference can pose a challenge.\nFastText's Solution for OOV Words: FastText overcomes the limitation of OOV words by providing embeddings for character n-grams. If an OOV word occurs during inference, FastText can still generate an embedding for it based on its constituent character n-grams. This ability makes FastText more robust and suitable for handling scenarios where encountering new or rare words are common, such as social media data or specialized domains.\nImproved Vector Representations for Morphologically Rich Languages:By leveraging character-level information and providing embeddings for OOV words, FastText significantly improves vector representations for morphologically rich languages. It captures only the semantic meaning but also the internal structure and syntactic relations of words, leading to more accurate and contextually rich embeddings."

This approach captures both the semantic meaning and the internal structure of the word, making FastText particularly effective for morphologically rich languages.\nDuring training, FastText utilizes models like Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) or Skip-gram, which are neural networks trained to predict context given a target word or vice versa. These models optimize neural network parameters to minimize loss, enabling FastText to learn meaningful word representations from large text corpora.\nFurthermore, FastText's ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words helps in real-world applications where encountering new or rare words is common. Trained FastText embeddings serve as powerful features for various NLP tasks, facilitating tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation with improved accuracy and efficiency."

It uses two architectures (CBOW and Skip-gram) to learn representations and excels in general language modeling tasks.\nFastText, developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab, extends Word2Vec's idea by not only learning embeddings for words but also for n-grams of characters within a word. This approach allows FastText to generate better embeddings for rare words or misspelled words by leveraging subword information.\nChoosing between FastText and Word2Vec depends on specific requirements: Word2Vec is generally preferred for tasks where there is large well-curated datasets and common vocabulary, whereas FastText shines in handling rare words and morphologically complex languages. For applications which needs robustness to word variations and misspellings, FastText may be the better choice."

    "output": "The Swin Transformer’s architecture is built on a combination of hierarchical design and window-based self-attention for efficient working and feature extraction.\nHere's how it works:\nPatch Splitting:The input image is divided into fixed-size patches like putting a grid over image and each square represent a patch. Each patch is then embedded into a feature vector to form input for the transformer.\nWindow-Based Self-Attention:Instead of computing attention globally the model computes attention within local windows. These windows act as small focused regions capturing fine features while keeping computation manageable. Self-attention is applied within the window and captures local features.\nShifted Windows for Cross-Region Interaction:The shifted window mechanism solve limitation of local windows attention and capture global context of image. This shifted window shifts the position of the windows by a small value and hence overlapping regions with next layer. This ensure cross-window communication and improve models ability to capture global context.\nHierarchical Design:The Swin Transformer processes the image in stages:\nStage 1:The image is divided into non-overlapping patches for embedding of each level.\nStage 2:These patches are further split into windows and self-attention is applied locally in the window.\nStage 3:The windows are shifted over next layer for overlapping and self-attention is recomputed with shifted windows.\nStage 4:Hierarchical processing continues combining features to know fine details in each window without losing global context of image.\nBy combining local self-attention within windows and hierarchical processing makes it scalable for high-resolution image processing without excessive computing power.

    "input": "Thresholding",
    "output": "Thresholding is one of the segmentation techniques that generates a binary image (a binary image is one whose pixels have only two values - 0 and 1 and thus requires only one bit to store pixel intensity) from a given grayscale image by separating it into two regions based on a threshold value. Hence pixels having intensity values greater than the said threshold will be treated as white or 1 in the output image and the others will be black or 0.\nSuppose the above is the histogram of an image f(x,y). We can see one peak near level 40 and another at 180. So there are two major groups of pixels - one group consisting of pixels having a darker shade and the others having a lighter shade. So there can be an object of interest set in the background. If we use an appropriate threshold value, say 90, will divide the entire image into two distinct regions.\nIn other words, if we have a threshold T, then the segmented image g(x,y) is computed as shown below:\ng(x,y) = 1 if f(x,y) > T and g(x,y) = 0 if f(x,y) ≤ T.\nSo the output segmented image has only two classes of pixels - one having a value of 1 and others having a value of 0.\nIf the threshold T is constant in processing over the entire image region, it is said to be global thresholding. If T varies over the image region, we say it is variable thresholding.\nMultiple-thresholding classifies the image into three regions - like two distinct objects on a background. The histogram in such cases shows three peaks and two valleys between them. The segmented image can be completed using two appropriate thresholds T1and T2.\ng(x,y) = a if f(x,y) > T2 and g(x,y) = b if T1 < f(x,y) ≤ T2 and g(x,y) = c if  f(x,y) ≤ T1\nwhere a, b and c are three distinct intensity values.\nFrom the above discussion, we may intuitively infer that the success of intensity thresholding is directly related to the width and depth of the valleys separating the histogram modes. In turn, the key factors affecting the properties of the valleys are the separation between peaks, the noise content in the image, and the relative sizes of objects and backgrounds. The more widely the two peaks in the histogram are separated, the better thresholding and hence image segmenting algorithms will work. Noise in an image often degrades this widely-separated two-peak histogram distribution and leads to difficulties in adequate thresholding and segmenting. When noise is present, it is appropriate to use some filter to clean the image and then apply segmentation. The relative object sizes play a role in determining the accuracy of segmentation."

  {
    "input": "Global Thresholding",
    "output": "When the intensity distribution of objects and background are sufficiently distinct, it is possible to use a single or global threshold applicable over the entire image. The basic global thresholding algorithm iteratively finds the best threshold value so segmenting.\nThe algorithm is explained below.\nThis algorithm works well for images that have a clear valley in their histogram. The larger the value of δ, the smaller will be the number of iterations. The initial estimate of T can be made equal to the average pixel intensity of the entire image.\nThe above simple global thresholding can be made optimum by using Otsu's method. Otsu's method is optimum in the sense that it maximizes the between-class variance. The basic idea is that well-thresholded classes or groups should be distinct with respect to the intensity values of their pixels and conversely, a threshold giving the best separation between classes in terms of their intensity values would be the best or optimum threshold."
  },
  {
    "input": "Variable Thresholding",
    "output": "There are broadly two different approaches to local thresholding. One approach is to partition the image into non-overlapping rectangles. Then the techniques of global thresholding or Otsu's method are applied to each of the sub-images. Hence in the image partitioning technique, the methods of global thresholding are applied to each sub-image rectangle by assuming that each such rectangle is a separate image in itself. This approach is justified when the sub-image histogram properties are suitable (have two peaks with a wide valley in between) for the application of thresholding techniques but the entire image histogram is corrupted by noise and hence is not ideal for global thresholding.\nThe other approach is to compute a variable threshold at each point from the neighborhood pixel properties. Let us say that we have a neighborhood Sxyof a pixel having coordinates (x,y). If the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensities in this neighborhood be mxyand σxy, then the threshold at each point can be computed as:\nT_{xy} = aσ_{xy} + bm_{xy}\nwhere a and b are arbitrary constants. The above definition of the variable threshold is just an example. Other definitions can also be used according to the need.\nThe segmented image is computed as:\ng(x,y) = 1 if f(x,y) > Txy g(x,y) = 0 if f(x,y) ≤ Txy.\nMoving averages can also be used as thresholds. This technique of image thresholding is the most general one and can be applied to widely different cases.\nExample 1:\nOutput:"

After the training phase, the algorithm uses the knowledge gained from the labeled data to identify patterns and predict the classes of new images.\nSupervised algorithms can be divided into single-label classification and multi-label classification. Single-label classification assigns a single label to an image, which is the most common type. Multi-label classification, on the other hand, allows an image to be assigned multiple labels, which is useful in fields like medical imaging where an image may show several diseases or anomalies.\nFamous supervisedclassification algorithmsinclude k-nearest neighbors,decision trees,support vector machines,random forests, linear and logistic regressions, and neural networks.\nFor instance,logistic regressionpredicts whether an image belongs to a certain category by modeling the relationship between input features and class probabilities.K-nearest neighbors(KNN) assigns labels based on the closest k data points to the new input, making decisions based on the majority class among the neighbors.Support vector machines(SVM) find the best separating boundary (hyperplane) between classes by maximizing the margin between the closest points of each class.

This method doesn't automatically provide a class; rather, it forms clusters that need to be interpreted and labeled. Notable clusterization algorithms includeK-means, Mean-Shift, DBSCAN, Expectation–Maximization (EM),Gaussian mixture models,Agglomerative Clustering,and BIRCH. For instance, K-means starts by selecting k initial centroids, then assigns each data point to the nearest centroid, recalculates the centroids based on the assigned points, and repeats the process until the centroids stabilize. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) take a more sophisticated approach by assuming that the data points are drawn from a mixture of Gaussian distributions, allowing them to capture more complex and overlapping data patterns.\nAmong the wide range of image classification techniques,convolutional neural networks(CNNs) are a game-changer for computer vision problems.

This includes resizing, normalising and converting the image into a format suitable for further analysis.\nSemantic Segmentation:In this step, each pixel in the image is assigned a label representing its category such as ‘car’, ‘tree’ or ‘road’. This process helps in understanding the general context of the image like identifying the different object types in the scene.\nInstance Segmentation: While semantic segmentation groups similar objects into the same category, instance segmentation goes further by distinguishing between different objects of the same category. For example, if the image contains multiple cars, it will assign unique identifiers to each one (e.g \"Car 1\", \"Car 2\"). It helps in identifying and isolating individual objects.\nCombining the Two: After semantic and instance segmentation are completed, the results are combined. Each pixel in the image gets both a category label from semantic segmentation and an instance identifier from instance segmentation.

We define our confidence score as follows :\nNote: the confidence score should be 0 when there is no object exists in the grid. If there is an object present in the image the confidence score should be equal to IoU between ground truth and predicted boxes. Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: (x, y, w, h) and confidence score. The (x, y) coordinates represent the centre of the box relative to the bounds of the grid cell. The h, w coordinates represents height, width of bounding box relative to (x, y). The confidence score represents the presence of an object in the bounding box.\nThis results in combination of bounding boxes from each grid like this.\nEach grid also predicts C conditional class probability, Pr(Classi| Object).\nThis probability were conditional based on the presence of an object in grid cell. Regardless the number of boxes each grid cell predicts only one set of class probabilities. These prediction are encoded in the 3D tensor of size S * S * (5*B +C).\nNow, we multiply the conditional class probabilities and the individual box confidence predictions,\n\nThis gives us class-specific confidence scores for each box. These scores encode both the probability of that class appearing in the box and how well the predicted box fits the object. Then after we apply non-maximal suppression for suppressing the non max outputs (when a number of boxes are predicted for the same object). At last , our  final predictions are generated.\nYOLO is very fast at the test time because it uses only a single CNN architecture to predict results and class is defined in such a way that it treats classification as a regression problem."

However, In terms of the accuracy of mAP, YOLO was not the state-of-the-art model but has a fairly good Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 63% when trained on PASCAL VOC 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2012. However, Fast R-CNN which was the state of the art at that time has an mAP of 71%.\nLater, YOLO (v2) and YOLO 9000 were proposed by J. Redmon and A. Farhadi in 2016 which at 67 FPS gave mAP of 76.8% on VOC 2007 dataset. Furthermore, in 2018, J. Redmon and A. Farhadi released YOLO (v3), which further improved object detection accuracy and speed. YOLO (v3) introduced a new backbone architecture, called Darknet-53, which improved feature extraction and added additional anchor boxes to better detect objects at different scales.

In this class while loading the data with its label we have to make sure of the following parts:\nBounding box label data should be in the[x, y, width, height, class_label]format where (x, y) represents the center coordinate of the object within the image, width is the width of the object's bounding box, height is the height of the object's bounding box, and class_label indicates the class to which the object belongs. We will follow this format because while applying transforms to the input image we need the bounding box data to be in this format to match the input transforms.\nWhile reading the input image we have to convert it into 3-channel (RGB format) input because some of the input is in grayscale.\nWhile loading the data, we will have target data for each box at different scales and we have to assign which anchor is responsible and which cell is responsible for the identification of that object(Generating a conditional probability map).\nNow, for training and testing, we will need to define transforms on which the input data will be processed before feeding it to the network.

This network is a hybrid of Darknet-19 and residual blocks along with some short connections in the network.\nThe bounding boxes are predicted at three different points in this network and on three different scales or grid sizes.

Instead of merely classifying objects, as in image classification, bounding box detection provides a more detailed understanding of the spatial extent of each object. This information is crucial for various applications, from autonomous vehicles to video surveillance.\nBuilding a bounding box prediction model from scratch using PyTorch involves creating a neural network that learns to localize objects within images. This task typically uses aconvolutional neural network(CNN) architecture to capture spatial hierarchies. The model is trained on a dataset with annotated bounding boxes. During training, the network refines its parameters through backpropagation, minimizing the difference between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. Key components include image preprocessing, defining the neural network architecture with regression outputs for box coordinates and optimizing with a loss function. Implementing such models enhances computer vision applications, enabling accurate object localization and detection."

A False Positive is when the model predicts a pixel as part of an object when it is part of the background.\nWe can define IoU as the ratio of the intersection of the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth mask to the union of the two masks. The formula for calculating IoU is as follows:\nwhere TP is the number of true positives, FP is the number of false positives, and FN is the number of false negatives.\nTo calculate IoU for an entire image, we need to calculate TP, FP, and FN for each pixel in the image and then sum them up. This can be a computationally expensive process, especially for large images. Therefore, it is common to calculate IoU for a subset of pixels in the image, such as a random sample of 1000 pixels."

    "output": "IoU is a widely used metric for evaluating image segmentation models because it provides a measure of how well the model is able to separate objects from their background in an image. A higher IoU score indicates a better segmentation performance, while a lower score indicates poorer performance.\nIoU is often used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positives in the ground truth. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall."

    "input": "Examples",
    "output": "Some examples of Intersection Over Union (IoU)  for Evaluating an image Segmentation Model are given below:\n1. Medical Imaging:\nSuppose a medical imaging company has developed an algorithm to segment brain tumors in MRI scans. The algorithm produces a binary mask for each scan, which indicates the predicted location of the tumor. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, the company can use IoU to compare the predicted masks with the ground truth masks provided by expert radiologists. A higher IoU score would indicate that the algorithm is accurately segmenting the tumors.\n2. Autonomous Driving:\nImagine a self-driving car company developing a model to segment objects in camera images captured by the car's sensors. The model needs to accurately identify objects such as pedestrians, cars, and bicycles to ensure safe driving. To evaluate the performance of the model, the company can use IoU to compare the predicted segmentation masks with the ground truth masks labeled by humans. A higher IoU score would indicate that the model is accurately segmenting objects, which is crucial for safe autonomous driving.\nHere is an example Java code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate IoU for evaluating an image segmentation model:\nIn this example, we have two masks - a ground truth mask and a predicted mask, both represented as two-dimensional arrays of 0's and 1's. The calculateIoU() function takes these two masks as input and calculates the true positives, false positives, and false negatives by iterating over each pixel in the masks. The function then uses these values to calculate the IoU using the formula described earlier in this article.\nIn this specific example, the ground truth mask and the predicted mask have an IoU of 0.67, which indicates that the predicted mask is overlapping with the ground truth mask to a certain extent but not entirely. The output of the code snippet will be:\nNote that this is a simple example and in practice, calculating IoU for an entire image can be computationally expensive. Therefore, it is common to calculate IoU for a subset of pixels in the image, as discussed earlier in this article."

In order to build a model, it is recommended to have GPU support, or you may use the Google colab notebooks as well."

    "input": "Stepwise Implementation:",
    "output": "The first step towards writing any code is to import all the required libraries and modules. This includes importing tensorflow and other modules like numpy. If the module is not present then you can download it usingpip install tensorflowon thecommand prompt (for windows)or if you are using a jupyter notebook then simply type!pip install tensorflowin the cell and run it in order to download the module. Other modules can be imported similarly.\nOutput:\nThe output of the above code should display the version of tensorflow you are using eg 2.4.1 or any other.\nNow we have the required module support so let's load in our data. The dataset of CIFAR-10 is available ontensorflowkeras API, and we can download it on our local machine usingtensorflow.keras.datasets.cifar10and then distribute it to train and test set usingload_data()function.\nOutput:\nThe output of the above code will display the shape of all four partitions and will look something like this\n\nHere we can see we have 5000 training images and 1000 test images as specified above and all the images are of 32 by 32 size and have 3 color channels i.e. images are color images. As well as it is also visible that there is only a single label assigned with each image.\nUntil now, we have our data with us. But still, we cannot be sent it directly to our neural network. We need to process the data in order to send it to the network. The first thing in the process is to reduce the pixel values. Currently, all the image pixels are in a range from 1-256, and we need to reduce those values to a value ranging between 0 and 1. This enables our model to easily track trends and efficient training. We can do this simply by dividing all pixel values by 255.0.\nAnother thing we want to do is to flatten(in simple words rearrange them in form of a row) the label values using the flatten() function.\nNow is a good time to see few images of our dataset. We can visualize it in a subplot grid form. Since the image size is just 32x32 so don't expect much from the image. It would be a blurred one. We can do the visualization using thesubplot()function from matplotlib and looping over the first 25 images from our training dataset portion.\nOutput:\n\nThough the images are not clear there are enough pixels for us to specify which object is there in those images.\nAfter completing all the steps now is the time to built our model. We are going to use a Convolution Neural Network or CNN to train our model. It includes using a convolution layer in this which is Conv2d layer as well as pooling and normalization methods. Finally, we'll pass it into a dense layer and the final dense layer which is our output layer. We are using 'relu' activation function. The output layer uses a \"softmax\" function.\nOutput:\n\nOur model is now ready, it's time to compile it. We are using model.compile() function to compile our model. For the parameters, we are using\nadam optimizer\nsparse_categorical_crossentropy as the loss function\nmetrics=['accuracy']\nNow let's fit our model using model.fit() passing all our data to it. We are going to train our model till 50 epochs, it gives us a fair result though you can tweak it if you want.\nOutput:\nThe model will start training, and it will look something like this\n\nAfter this, our model is trained. Though it will work fine but to make our model much more accurate we can add data augmentation on our data and then train it again. Calling model.fit() again on augmented data will continue training where it left off. We are going to fir our data on a batch size of 32 and we are going to shift the range of width and height by 0.1 and flip the images horizontally. Then call model.fit again for 50 epochs.\nOutput:\nThe model will start training for 50 epochs. Though it is running on GPU it will take at least 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nNow we have trained our model, before making any predictions from it let's visualize the accuracy per iteration for better analysis. Though there are other methods that includeconfusion matrixfor better analysis of the model.\nOutput:\nLet's make a prediction over an image from our model using model.predict() function. Before sending the image to our model we need to again reduce the pixel values between 0 and 1 and change its shape to (1,32,32,3) as our model expects the input to be in this form only. To make things easy let us take an image from the dataset itself. It is already in reduced pixels format still we have to reshape it (1,32,32,3) using reshape() function. Since we are using data from the dataset we can compare the predicted output and original output.\nOutput:\n\nNow we have the output asOriginal label is cat and the predicted label is also cat.\nLet's check it for some label which was misclassified by our model, e.g. forimage number 5722we receive something like this:\n\nFinally, let's save our model usingmodel.save()function as an h5 file. If you are using Google colab you can download your model from the files section.\nHence, in this way, one can classify images using Tensorflow."

If we wanted to classify an image into a new category, we needed to fine-tune the model which required both computational resources and high-quality datasets. But CLIP’s most important innovations is its ability to performzero-shot learning.\nThis means that once trained, it can classify images into any category without needing to have been explicitly trained on that category. It is done by using both images and text in training, it can classify images into categories it wasn’t explicitly trained on"

For example, an image classification model could be trained to identify and label an image, if the image contains a cat, a dog, a car, a human or a specific object.\nExplained below are different types of image classification, and how image classification works.\nThere are two main types of image classification for categorizing images into predefined classes:\nSingle-Label Classification: In single-label classification, each image is assigned to one single category, where the goal is to predict one label per image. For example, classifying an image as containing a cat or a dog.\nMulti-Label Classification: Multiple-Label classification involves assigning multiple labels to an image which has multiple objects.

Each pixel in an image is categorized and assigned a label based on the object it belongs. When an semantic segmentation is done on an image the output is a 'segmentation map' where each pixel's color represents its class.\nInstance Segmentation:Instance segmentation delves into the image at a more granular level by identifying and delineating each individual instance of those objects. It is something like, as an example of, having different coloured cats in an image. Another good example could be, imagine a group photo of students. Semantic segmentation labels everyone as 'person', and instance segmentation would identify and outline each individual person in the group photo.\nThere is also another segmentation type calledPanoptic Segmentationwhich combines both semantic and instance segmentation to provide a complete understanding of every pixel in the image.\nImage segmentationprocess is used in various applications like medical imaging, to identify tumours or organ health and in autonomous driving to assist in distinguishing between road, vehicles, and pedestrians."

It uses a combination of techniques includingdeep learning,computer visionalgorithms, andImage processing. These technologies are used to enable a system to detect, recognize, and verify faces in digital images or videos.\nThe technology has become increasingly popular in a wide variety of applications such as unlocking a smartphone, unlocking doors, passport authentication, security systems, medical applications, and so on. There are even models that can detect emotions from facial expressions.\nFace recognition is the process of identifying a person from an image or video feed andface detectionis the process of detecting a face in an image or video feed. In the case of  Face recognition, someone’s face is recognized and differentiated based on their facial features. It involves more advanced processing techniques to identify a person’s identity based on feature point extraction, and comparison algorithms.  and can be used for applications such as automated attendance systems or security checks. While Face detection is a much simpler process and can be used for applications such as image tagging or altering the angle of a photo based on the face detected. it is the initial step in the face recognition process and is a simpler process that simply identifies a face in an image or video feed."

  {
    "input": "Image Processing and Machine learning",
    "output": "Image processing by computers involves the process of Computer Vision. It deals with a high-level understanding of digital images or videos. The requirement is to automate tasks that the human visual systems can do. So, a computer should be able to recognize objects such as the face of a human being or a lamppost, or even a statue.\nThe computer reads any image in a range of values between 0 and 255. For any color image, there are 3 primary colors – Red, green, and blue. A matrix is formed for every primary color and later these matrices combine to provide a Pixel value for the individual R, G, and B colors. Each element of the matrices provide data about the intensity of the brightness of the pixel.\nOpenCVis a Python library that is designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV was originally developed in 1999 by Intel but later supported by Willow Garage.\nEveryMachine Learning algorithmtakes a dataset as input and learns from the data it basically means to learn the algorithm from the provided input and output as data. It identifies the patterns in the data and provides the desired algorithm. For instance, to identify whose face is present in a given image, multiple things can be looked at as a pattern:\nHeight/width of the face.\nHeight and width may not be reliable since the image could be rescaled to a smaller face or grid. However, even after rescaling, what remains unchanged are the ratios – the ratio of the height of the face to the width of the face won’t change.\nColor of the face.\nWidth of other parts of the face like lips, nose, etc.\nThere is a pattern involved – different faces have different dimensions like the ones above. Similar faces have similar dimensions. Machine Learning algorithms only understand numbers so it is quite challenging. This numerical representation of a “face” (or an element in the training set) is termed as a feature vector. A feature vector comprises of various numbers in a specific order.\nAs a simple example, we can map a “face” into a feature vector which can comprise various features like:\nHeight of face (cm)\nWidth of the face (cm)\nAverage color of face (R, G, B)\nWidth of lips (cm)\nHeight of nose (cm)\nEssentially, given an image, we can convert them into a feature vector like:\nHeight of face (cm) Width of the face (cm) Average color of face (RGB) Width of lips (cm) Height of nose (cm)\n23.1 15.8 (255, 224, 189) 5.2 4.4\nSo, the image is now a vector that could be represented as (23.1, 15.8, 255, 224, 189, 5.2, 4.4). There could be countless other features that could be derived from the image,, for instance, hair color, facial hair, spectacles, etc.\nMachine Learning does two major functions in face recognition technology. These are given below:\nFace Recognition Operations\nThe technology system may vary when it comes to facial recognition. Different software applies different methods and means to achieve face recognition. The stepwise method is as follows:\nFace Detection:To begin with, the camera will detect and recognize a face. The face can be best detected when the person is looking directly at the camera as it makes it easy for facial recognition. With the advancements in technology, this is improved where the face can be detected with slight variation in their posture of face facing the camera.\nFace Analysis:Then the photo of the face is captured and analyzed. Most facial recognition relies on 2D images rather than 3D because it is more convenient to match to the database. Facial recognition software will analyze the distance between your eyes or the shape of your cheekbones.\nImage to Data Conversion:Now it is converted to a mathematical formula and these facial features become numbers. This numerical code is known as a face print. The way every person has a unique fingerprint, in the same way, they have unique face prints.\nMatch Finding:Then the code is compared against a database of other face prints. This database has photos with identification that can be compared. The technology then identifies a match for your exact features in the provided database. It returns with the match and attached information such as name and address or it depends on the information saved in the database of an individual."

With these facial expressions, the machine could make mistakes to find the correct person's identity.\nAging:With time and age face changes it is unique and does not remain rigid due to which it may be difficult to identify a person who is now 60 years old.\nOcclusion:Occlusion means blockage. This is due to the presence of various occluding objects such as glasses, beard, mustache, etc. on the face, and when an image is captured, the face lacks some parts.  Such a problem can severely affect the classification process of the recognition system.\nIllumination:Illumination means light variations. Illumination changes can vary the overall magnitude of light intensity reflected from an object, as well as the pattern of shading and shadows visible in an image. The problem of face recognition over changes in illumination is widely recognized to be difficult for humans and algorithms. The difficulties posed by illumination condition is a challenge for automatic face recognition systems.\nIdentify similar faces:Different persons may have a similar appearance that sometimes makes it impossible to distinguish.\nDisadvantages of Face Recognition"

    "output": "DeepFake usesDeep Learning, a subset ofMachine Learning, to create videos that look real but are actually fake. It is basically a technology that can replace the face of a person in an image or a video with so much precision that it looks real. Or it can make a person say something on a video that they never actually said in real life. \"What you see is what you get\" is no longer true on the internet because of DeepFakes. And that is how you can see Jon Snow blaming the last season of Game of Thrones when this never actually happened!"
  },
  {
    "input": "How DeepFakes Are Made?",
    "output": "Aneural network algorithmknown as anautoencodercan be used for creating DeepFakes which attach a fake face to an original face. Suppose you want to attach the face of Jon Snow to Tyrion Lannister. To do that you take thousands of collected photos of both Jon and Tyrion and run them through a neural network called anencoder. This encoder will study the facial features in both faces and compress the images into the standard features they both have.\nThen a neural network called adecoderwill take these compressed images and recover the face of Jon. Similarly, another decoder will do this for Tyrion. To get Jon's face on Tyrion's face, all you have to do is take a compressed image of Jon's face and feed it into the decoder that was trained on images of Tyrion.\nSo, this decoder will reconstruct Tyrion's face but it will use all the mannerisms and expressions that appear on Jon's face. This has to be done on every image frame in a video to show Tyrion Lannister actually looking like Jon Snow, which is very weird to imagine! Another method to create DeepFakes uses aGenerative Adversarial Network(GAN).\nThis basically involves two neural networks that are known as theGeneratorand theDiscriminatorrespectively. The Generator creates fake images using a data set of existing real images like celebrities. Then the Discriminator tries to catch any defects in the generated images. The fake images created by the Generator at the beginning are obviously fake and don't even look like faces but with multiple passes, a real-looking fake image can be created.\nThis is a classic case of \"Fake it till you make it!\". In fact, it is even easier to create fake images if there is a large training data set of images already available. That is why celebrities and famous people are targeted the most. They have the most images and videos out in public."
  },
  {
    "input": "How DeepFakes Work?",
    "output": "As discussed above, Deepfakes replicate the data of faces and expressions which cannot be easily identified by a human eye. Whereas, GAN produces data that learns from deep learning and uses generators and discriminators.\nToday there are apps likeDeepFaceLabthat learn by themselves from the provided inputs along with the facial expressions layer by layer and accordingly manipulate the data. In short, it can also be considered as a video editor tool that can be masked with the original video and replace the desired faces.\nAlthough it will take some more time for accuracy it is heavily being used in movies and entertainment industries. Besides this, marketers are also trying to experiment with different promotional content without hiring any models/actors. You may also find some minor project apps that are based on Deepfakes technology which can be used to swap faces and do create some funny videos."

Nobody has ever thought that a small video can create chaos if projected in the wrong way.\nThere are certain videos available on the internet that are hard to identify whether it's real or fake, however, attributes like facial structure, expressions, iris, etc. make them more realistic. This makes a clear indication thatdeepfakes are a potential threat to cybersecurity.\nTo handle such threats governments of different countries have made laws against this technology so that it cannot be used for the wrong purpose. In 2019, WIPO (Word Intellectual Property Organization) submitted a draft that addresses thedeepfakes issue and the measure to handle the challenges."
  },
  {
    "input": "How Do You Do DeepFakes?",
    "output": "As discussed above,deepfakes run on neural network type(autoencoder) which decreases the image's latent space and reconstructs it from the provided input. In this, the AI trains itself on how the manipulation has to be done and then copies the elements of the key features such as facial expressions, posture, etc. The processing is being done in frames for each element like talking, iris movement, body action, etc.\nFor such activity, a large set of data is being fed into the deepfakes so that their AI-based algorithm start processing which later converts the desired output into two chunks i.e.motion estimator and video generator."

    "input": "Are DeepFakes Dangerous?",
    "output": "DeepFakes are used for everything currently: the good, the bad, and the ugly. There are many videos created using DeepFake that are just for fun and not going to harm anybody. Jon Snow apologizing for Game of Thrones is one such example! DeepFakes have also been used in films. One example is when Harrison Ford's young face was inserted onto Han Solo's face in Solo: A Star Wars Story.\nBut more and more, DeepFakes are being used maliciously. According to an estimate,at least 96% of DeepFakes online are pornographic in naturewhere images of celebrities or other famous women are mapped on the faces of porn stars.\nThis is a serious threat to many women. Anotherfuture threat of DeepFakes is the loss of trust. It is becoming more and more difficult to identify if a photo or video is real or fake. In this situation, it would become very difficult to trust anything as the truth. This can have huge ramifications. For example, courts would not be able to identify if a piece of evidence is real or fake in cases.\nAlso, security systems that rely on facial or voice recognition could also be tricked using DeepFakes in the future. And could you ever be sure that the person you are calling on your phone is real or just a voice-and-face imitation using DeepFake?"
  },
  {
    "input": "How Do You Spot a DeepFake?",
    "output": "Unless you are anArtificial Intelligence algorithm, it is very difficult to spot a DeepFake! However, you can still do it if you look closely as they are fake after all. The most common sign is that the ears, teeth, and eyes of the person do not match the face outline sometimes. Lip syncing in the video may also be wrong and it is very difficult to create individual strands of hair in DeepFakes. And if the face appears too smooth to be real, chances are it's not real but a DeepFake.\nHowever, it is getting more and more difficult to spot DeepFakes as they are looking more and more real with advances in technology. In such a situation,only Artificial Intelligence can recognize the use of Artificial Intelligence in photos and videos. Almost all big tech companies are investing in creatingtechnology that can identify DeepFakes.\nOne of the biggest efforts in this is the Deepfake Detection Challenge by Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook which aims to identify fake content on the internet (which is getting more and more difficult to do!) Hopefully, all these measures will be enough tospot DeepFakes in the future. Otherwise, there may come a time when funny videos about Jon Snow would be the least of the DeepFake problems in this world. And even international catastrophes may happen because of the fake news spread by DeepFakes."

Here's what is need and why each is essential:\nVisual Perception:Current AI is good at recognizing objects but it usually has a hard time in dealing with the context depth and unseen of objects. AGI would have to be able to recognize the real world to understand the subtle visual cues and to interact with objects in an effective way that is similar to humans.\nAudio Perception:Just like visionAIcan cope with speech as well but the interpretation of intent, tone and background noises is still a problem. Artificial General Intelligence  would have to process audio like humans, the elimination of the unneeded noise and the comprehension of the speech with the subtle variations would be its tasks.\nFine Motor Skills:Today, the robots are great yet their movements look clumsy and are not so accurate as the human hands. AGI would need the ability to handle the physical things, do the fine tasks, and fit into our environment without any trouble.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP):This is an important aspect of the growth. NLP is the process that makes AI able to grab and answer human language. AGI is a perfect example that the near-perfect NLP is required to communicate with humans and to deal with the complexities of the human language.\nProblem Solving:Although AI is able to solve some problems, it is not as creative as humans and it cannot approach new problems the way humans do. Artificial General Intelligence  would need to have advanced problem-solving capabilities to deal with the unexpected situations and make decisions through the complex issues, and adapt to the changing environment.\nNavigation:AI can manage in the controlled environments, however, the real world that is very dynamic and unpredictable is another story. AGI would have to be a navigational expert, planning the route, avoiding the obstacles and adapting to the surroundings changes.\nCreativity:The human brain is impressed by the creativity. The AI can create new text formats, but it usually does not grab the deep meaning and come up with new ones. Artificial General Intelligence would have some degree of creativity so that it could think beyond the box, invent new solutions and be able to create art.\nSocial and Emotional Engagement:Social skills are the key elements of human intelligence. The comprehension of emotions and the ability to react to the ones and the success of the relationships are all the main parts of the social interaction. Although some AI systems are able to imitate the simple emotions, the social and emotional interaction with humans is a challenge that AGI has to face to become fully integrated with human society."

These systems excel in their respective domains, but they are incapable of performing tasks outside of their defined parameters. Siri can understand voice commands and answer questions based on the data it is trained on, but it cannot analyze complex medical reports or write poetry from scratch without specific data input.\nThe underlying principle behind Narrow AI is that these systems usemachine learning,deep learning, ornatural language processing (NLP)algorithms to process vast amounts of data, learn patterns, and make decisions based on this learning. The training phase is crucial, as Narrow AI systems rely heavily on the data they are exposed to during training, which defines their accuracy and performance."

    "input": "Problem with Traditional Fine-Tuning",
    "output": "Fine-Tuningtakes the pre-trained model and adapt the model for specific task. For example, BERT or GPT can be fine-tuned to perform sentiment analysis or text summarization. Traditionally, fine-tuning involves updating all the parameters (weights) of the model based on the new data. This works well but the problem is that modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are huge and have billions of parameters.\nImagine we have alarge language modelwith 100 billion parameters. If we fine-tune all those parameters for every new task, we'll need a lot of computing power and storage. To solve this problem, researchers developed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). With PEFT, we can achieve similar performance by tweaking only a small fraction of the model making it faster, cheaper and easier to manage while still giving strong performance."

Start with a Pre-trained Model:We begin with a large language model (LLM) such as GPT, BERT or T5 that is already trained on massive amounts of text. This model contains general knowledge about language.\n2. Freeze the Original Weights:Instead of updating all the billions of weights, we keep them fixed. This saves computing power and avoids the need to store multiple full versions of the model.\n3. Add Lightweight Components:Since the main model is frozen, we introduce tiny, task-specific modules or allow updates only to certain parameters. These are the only parts that will be trained. Some common techniques are:\nAdapters: Small layers added between existing layers to capture task-specific adjustments.\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):Adds compact matrices that approximate updates without touching the main weights.\nBitFit: Updates only bias terms in the model which are very few in number.\nPrompt / Prefix Tuning: Attaches short, learnable prompt vectors that guide the model’s behavior for each task.\n4. Train Only the New Parts:During fine-tuning, we update just the added or selected parameters and the frozen weights stays untouched.\n5. Deploy Efficiently:For each new task, we only need to save the small trained modules not the full model which means:\nOne big pre-trained model can serve many tasks.\nSwitching tasks is as simple as loading the right lightweight module."

However, ethics need not be a barrier. Consider it a step in the creative process instead. You can develop AI solutions that are not onlyinnovative but also reliableand significant if you take ethical considerations into account from the beginning.\nLack of Diverse Perspectives: The diversity required to identifypotential biases or comprehend the wider implicationsof their systems is frequently lacking in AI development teams. Bringing in diverse perspectives is more important than simply having a diverse range of backgrounds. You can identify blind spots and improve the inclusivity and efficacy of your AI systems by bringing inethicists, social scientists, and domain experts in addition to technical staff.\nKeeping Up with Rapid AI Advancements: It may seem impossible for ethical standards and laws to keep up with the rapid advancements in AI technology.Establish guiding principlesrather than attempting to develop a rule for every scenario that might arise. You can makeprompt, well-informed decisionsthat are consistent with your values and navigate new developments with the assistance of a committed ethics committee or team.\nMeasuring Ethical Success: How do you quantify things like transparency or fairness? It's a challenging yet crucial component ofresponsible AI. Creating measurable metrics and benchmarks is crucial. This could involvemonitoring user trust levels, conducting frequent bias audits, or counting the number of ethical issuesthat are found and fixed over time. Quantifiable data keeps your efforts accountable and on course.\nResource Limitations: It can be daunting to implement ethical AI practices, particularly for smaller companies with tighter budgets and less time. However, you don't have to completely revamp everything at once.Begin modestly.

    "input": "How Zero-Shot Prompting Works?",
    "output": "Zero-shot promptingworks by allowing an AI model to perform tasks without the need for examples or additional training on task-specific data. The process leverages the model's pre-existing knowledge and training, enabling it to tackle a wide range of queries directly.\nHere’s a more detailed breakdown of how it works:\nUser Query: Process begins when the model receives a query or task from the user. For example, if the user asks, \"What is the capital of Japan?\", the model takes this question as its input. Importantly, no additional examples or context are provided to guide the model in solving the query.\nTask Understanding: Despite not receiving explicit examples, the AI model processes the query and infers the task from its extensive training data. Zero-shot prompting relies entirely on the model’s pre-trained knowledge to understand the task. Model has learned from a large corpus of diverse text data during training, enabling it to generalize to tasks it has never explicitly encountered.\nModel Processing: With its pre-trained knowledge, the model analyzes the query. It uses the context and patterns it has learned during its training to understand how to address the task at hand. The model does not need examples to learn the task because it already has the underlying concepts from the data it was trained on. For example, it understands that asking for the capital of a country requires it to recall geographical information.\nGenerated Output: Finally, the model generates a response based on its understanding of the task. For the question about Japan's capital, the model will output \"Tokyo,\" which it knows as a fact from its training. It retrieves the relevant information without needing additional context, relying entirely on its pre-existing knowledge to provide an accurate and relevant answer.\nIn this way, zero-shot prompting allows the AI model to tackle new tasks, answering questions or performing actions it has never been explicitly trained on, all by leveraging the knowledge embedded during its initial training. This approach highlights the model's ability to generalize and efficiently handle diverse queries across various domains."

Another agent \"server\" or \"remote\" agent (OrderBot) performs the task by querying the inventory.\nThese roles can switch during the conversation which is a core feature of the communication protocol.\nExample: CustomerBot (the client) asks OrderBot (the server) to check if an item is available for purchase.\n2. Agent Card\nAn Agent Card is a JSON file that acts as an agent’s profile.\nIt includes the agent’s ID, name, role, security needs and available capabilities.\nThis helps client agents find the right server agent for a specific task.\nExample:CustomerBot consults OrderBot’s Agent Card to see if OrderBot has the capability to check inventory.\n3. Task-Based Workflow\nThe main unit of work is called a task.\nThe stages it goes through are: Submitted (started), Working (in progress), Input-required (needs more information), Completed (finished successfully), Failed (encountered an error) or Cancelled (stopped early).\nExample: OrderBot goes through the task stages, starting with checking inventory and finally confirming availability.\n4. Message Structure\nDuring task execution, agents communicate using messages.\nMessages contain parts that hold content such as text, files, data or forms allowing exchange of rich information.\nExample: CustomerBot requests inventory information by sending a message to OrderBot.\n5. Artifacts for Results\nThe output of a completed task is delivered as artifacts.\nThese artifacts are structured results, ensuring the final output is consistent and easy to use.\nExample: Once OrderBot completes the inventory check it provides an artifact with structured results."

    "input": "Why perform preprocessing to Audio datasets?",
    "output": "There are various reasons to perform audio data preprocessing, which are listed below:"
  },
  {
    "input": "Step-by-step implementation",
    "output": "At first, we need to install all required Python module to our runtime.\nNow we will import all requiredPythonlibraries likeNumPy,SciPy,LibrosaandOSetc.\nNow we will load a small audio dataset for further implementations. You can download it fromhereor directly load it to runtime by the following code.\nResampling is the process of changing the sample rate of an audio signal. It involves adjusting the number of samples per second while preserving the original content's perceptual characteristics. This is commonly done to standardize audio data to a specific sample rate which makes it compatible with models or systems that require a uniform sampling frequency. Resampling can help in mitigating issues related to mismatched sample rates and enhancing the computational efficiency of subsequent processing steps. Here we will define a small function(resample_audio)to resample the audio files to a constant and specified sampling rate.\nOutput:\nSo, we have resampled one audio file of the dataset to our desired sampling rate. We can now just iterate the dataset to resample all the files. We will see that in this article further.\nWhen Audio data pre-processing is required then one of the most important steps is Filtering which typically involves the application of signal processing filters like low-pass, high-pass or band-pass filters. Filtering is used to modify the frequency content of an audio signal by attenuating or emphasizing certain frequency components which may lead to make problem during model feeding like high background noise. In general cases, Low-pass filtering is applied to audio data to remove high-frequency noise which ensures that the model focuses on relevant signal information. Here we will define a small function(butter_lowpass_filter)to remove the background noises.\nOutput:\nAs we can see the filtering is successful the shape is very irrelevant for further task. From this context we are going to see how we can convert it to model's expected input shape.\nConverting audio data to the model's expected input involves shaping the raw audio signal into a format suitable for feeding into a machine learning model. This often includes operations such as trimming, padding, or extracting specific features from the audio data. The goal is to create a standardized representation that aligns with the input requirements of the model architecture. This step ensures that the model can effectively process and learn from the audio data during training or make accurate predictions during inference. Here we will define a small function(convert_to_model_input)by which we will trim the audio files to a fixed target length which is here 16000 as it is most general input shape for model feeding. You can change this which in the code as per your requirement.\nOutput:\nTill now we have performed resampling, filtering and converting the shape of the audio data to model's expected input shape. But it is impossible to do this tasks in one by one audio files if the audio dataset is large. And we need all the audio files in same nature to use them for further tasks. From here we will consider Audio data streaming which is a process of handling and processing audio data in a sequential, batched or real-time manner. Instead of loading the entire dataset into memory at once, streaming allows the model to process data in chunks or batches which facilitates efficient memory usage and enables the model to handle datasets that may not fit entirely into memory. This approach is crucial for training models on extensive audio datasets or when dealing with continuous audio streams in real-time applications. Here we will define a function(stream_audio_dataset)which will call all other three previous functions for resampling, filtering and converting to process the all the audio files present in the dataset batch-wise. The batch size should be defined as per the dataset size and hardware resources.\nThe generator function stream_audio_dataset loads and processes the audio files from a specified dataset path.\nthe audio_files is a list containing the path of all audios in the specified dataset.\nthe list of audio file paths is shuffled to introduce randomness.\nIn the batch processing step,the function yields batches of audio data with a specified batch size.for each batch, the code loads and preprocesses each audio file in the batch.audio files are loaded using Librosa, and resampling is applied if a target sampling rate is mentioned.Low pass filter is applied to each audio file.\nthe function yields batches of audio data with a specified batch size.\nfor each batch, the code loads and preprocesses each audio file in the batch.\naudio files are loaded using Librosa, and resampling is applied if a target sampling rate is mentioned.\nLow pass filter is applied to each audio file.\nThe generator processes the batches of audio data from the specified dataset path.\nEach batch is printed with the shape of the first file in the batch.\nOutput:\nSo, from this output we can see that inconsistent shapes after filtering and resampling are getting processed batch-wise and then each audio file of the batch is getting a consistent shape of (16000,). This indicates that the dataset is now well prepared for further complex tasks.\nA log-mel spectrogram is a representation of the frequency content of an audio signal over time, widely used in audio signal processing and machine learning applications. It is derived from the Mel spectrogram, which divides the audio spectrum into perceptually relevant frequency bands called Mel bins. The log-mel spectrogram further enhances visualization by taking the logarithm of the power values which makes it more suitable for human perception and aiding in the extraction of meaningful features. This representation is particularly valuable for tasks like speech recognition, sound classification and music analysis, where it captures essential acoustic characteristics and patterns in the audio signal. The resulting log-mel spectrogram provides a compact and informative representation that is commonly used as input to deep learning models for audio-based tasks. Here we will define a small function to generate log-mel spectrogram for this dataset's audio signals.\nOutput:"

After that, the pre-trained model possesses a deep understanding of language patterns and semantics, providing a strong foundation for subsequent tasks.\nKnowledge Retrieval Mechanism:A distinctive feature of RAG is the inclusion of a knowledge retrieval mechanism that enables the model to access external information during the generation process. It can employ various techniques like dense retrieval methods or traditional search algorithms, to pull in relevant knowledge from a vast repository.\nGenerative Backbone:The pre-trained language model forms the generative backbone of RAG which is responsible for producing coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input and retrieved knowledge.\nContextual Understanding:RAG excels in contextual understanding due to the integration of the pre-trained language model, allowing it to grasp nuances and dependencies within the input text.\nJoint Training:RAG undergoes joint training by optimizing both the generative capabilities of the pre-trained model and the effectiveness of the knowledge retrieval mechanism. This dual optimization ensures that the model produces high-quality outputs while leveraging external information appropriately.\nAdaptive Knowledge Integration:RAG provides flexibility in knowledge integration, allowing adaptability to various domains and tasks. Now, the model can dynamically adjust its reliance on external knowledge based on the nature of the input and the requirements of the generation task.\nEfficient Training and Inference:While RAG introduces a knowledge retrieval component, efforts are made to ensure computational efficiency during training and inference, addressing potential challenges related to scalability and real-time applications."

    "output": "Fine-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a tricky strategy which involves the retraining of a pre-existing or pre-trained language model on a specific, often task-specific, dataset to enhance its performance in a targeted domain.\nThe key-working principle of Fine-tuning is listed below:\nPre-trained Model Initialization:Similar to RAG, Fine-tuning also begins with the initialization of a pre-trained language model that has been previously trained on a large and diverse dataset. The pre-training phase equips the model with a generalized understanding of language patterns, semantics and context which makes it a valuable starting point for various NLP tasks.\nTask-specific Dataset:After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset which is tailored to the nuances of the target application or domain. This dataset contains examples relevant to the specific task, allowing the model to adapt and specialize its knowledge for improved performance.\nTransfer Learning:Fine-tuning leverages the principles of transfer learning where the knowledge gained during the pre-training phase is transferred and further refined for the target task. This transfer of knowledge enables the model to generalize better to the specifics of the new task, even when limited task-specific data is available.\nAdaptation to Task-specific Patterns:The fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt its parameters to the task-specific patterns present in the target dataset. By adjusting its weights and biases during training on the task-specific dataset, the model refines its ability to capture relevant features and patterns for the intended application. We can employ various evaluation metrics like accuracy, WER etc. to check the fine-tuning state.\nPrevention of Overfitting:Given the potential risk of overfitting to the limited task-specific data, fine-tuning often incorporates regularization techniques or dropout layers to prevent the model from becoming too specialized and performing poorly on new, unseen data."

In the other hand, fine-tuning does not generate biased data but if we start with wrong pre-trained model then Fine-tuning becomes useless.

Also, we use multiple windows of various sizes just to make sure that all sizes of the target object present in the input image are detected.\nJust like face-detection, the sliding window model is also used to efficiently cover long texts of input data. (topic covered in depth below)\nMathematics\nIn this, we have a fixed window of size w. Each token attends to (1/2)w tokens on each side (as shown in Fig. 2). The time complexity of this pattern thus becomes O(n × w), where n is the input sequence length.\nThus, this attention pattern employs a fixed-size window attention surrounding each token. We use multiple stacked layers of such windowed attention so as to cover a large receptive field, where top layers have access to all input locations. This gives the model the ability to cover the entire input sequence fed to it. (very similar to CNNs)"

    "output": "LongFormer (Long document transformer)is an upgrade to the previous transformer models such as SpanBERT as it aims to overcome the issues of accepting long sequenced strings (more than 512 tokens) as input. It adapted aCNNlike architecture known as Sliding Window Attention to do so. See Fig 2 for better understanding.\nThe problem with CNN is that it assumes that one word w could be related to any of the other words w'. Hence, it takes into consideration all the possible combination of words that could be related. So, the time complexity of the computation increases drastically.\nAs discussed above, the LongFormer calculations are based on the assumption that the most important information related to a given word is present in its surrounding neighbors. So, the given word is allowed access to its left and right neighbors (w/2 on both sides).\nSee Fig 3 for a better understanding.\nUnlike CNN, where there is a full connection, the sliding window approach leads to lesser mappings as only the neighboring words are taken into consideration. Hence the time complexity for the computations is also improved."

So, on a broader perspective, 64 tokens of input attend to only 192 relevant key tokens instead of considering all key tokens.(Shown in Fig 6)This makes the modelmuch more efficientthan the CNN full connection model."

Diffusion is the movement of particles or molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, driven by random thermal motion.\nIn many systems, especially those with disorder or heterogeneity, standard diffusion models like Fick's laws may not adequately describe the behavior observed. The Stable Diffusion Model addresses this by considering scenarios where the underlying distribution of displacements of diffusing particles has heavy tails, meaning that rare, extreme events occur more frequently than would be predicted by a normal distribution.\nThe Stable Diffusion Model is based on stable distributions, which are aclassof probability distributions characterized by heavy tails. These distributions are defined by four parameters: the stability index α, skewness β, scale parameter γ, and location parameter δ.\nThe Stable Diffusion Model is particularly useful for describing diffusion in systems where standard models fail, such as in porous media, biological systems, or financial markets. It has applications in various fields including physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and finance.\nOne of the key advantages of the Stable Diffusion Model is its ability to capture non-Gaussian behavior, making it more suitable for systems with complex dynamics or heterogeneity. However, analyzing data using this model can be challenging due to the complexity of stable distributions and the need for specialized statistical methods."

It operates on the principle of diffusion models, which aim to model the process of how a signal, such as an image, evolves. However, what sets Stable Diffusion apart is its ability to generate stable and coherent samples by leveraging a diffusion process that minimizes noise accumulation over time.\nIn Stable Diffusion, the process begins with an initial noisy image, which is gradually refined through a series of diffusion steps. Each step involves applying a carefully designed diffusion process that smooths out the noise while preserving the essential features of the image. This iterative refinement continues until the noise level is sufficiently reduced, resulting in a high-quality sample that closely resembles the images in the dataset.\nOne key aspect of Stable Diffusion is its stability, which ensures that the generated samples exhibit consistent quality and coherence. This stability is achieved by carefully controlling the diffusion process and incorporating techniques to prevent the amplification of noise during generation. Additionally, Stable Diffusion often incorporates advanceddeep learningarchitectures, such asneural networks,to further enhance the quality of generated samples.\nStable Diffusion represents a significant advancement in generative AI, offering a powerful approach for generating realistic and high-fidelity images from complex datasets.

For example, \"unhappiness\" might be split into \"un,\" \"happi,\" and \"ness.\"\nPunctuation: Punctuation marks like periods, commas, and exclamation marks are also treated as individual tokens.\nSpecial Tokens: Special tokens are used for specific purposes, such as indicating the beginning or end of a sentence, padding tokens, or tokens for unknown words.\nLLMs have a maximum number of tokens they can process in a single request. This limit includes both the input (prompt) and the output (generated text).\nFor example:\nGPT-4 has a context window of 8,192 tokens, with some versions supporting up to 32,768 tokens.\nExceeding this limit requires truncating or splitting the text."

The laminated silicon steel core of the transformer is covered by two distinct windings.\nAccording to the diagram below, the primary winding is the one to which the AC supply is connected, and the secondary winding is the one to which the load is connected. Only alternating current can be used because mutual induction between the two windings requires an alternating flux.\nThe transformer primary winding produces an alternating flux, known as the mutual flux, when an alternating voltage is applied, in accordance with the mutual inductance principle.\nFrom the expression above, it is clear that the size of EMFsE1and E2is dependent on the number of turns in the transformer primary and secondary windings, respectively. IfN2> N1,thenE2> E1, and the transformer will be a step-up transformer; ifN2< N1, then E2< E1, and the transformer will be a step-down transformer.\nIf a load is now connected across the secondary winding, the load currentI2will flow through the load as a result of the EMFE2.As a result, a transformer makes it possible to transfer electricity with a change in voltage level from one electric circuit to another."

It can also be lowered if the core is well-designed.\nWindings Resistance:Because the wire used for the windings has some electrical resistance, energy is wasted as a result of the heat generated in the windings. These are mitigated in high current, low voltage windings by utilizing thick wire with a high conductive substance.\nEddy Currents:The alternating magnetic flux creates eddy currents in the iron core, resulting in energy losses through heating. By using a laminated core, the impact is decreased.\nHysteresis Loss:In each AC cycle, the alternating magnetic field reverses the magnetization of the core.

    "output": "Diffusion models are generative models that learn to reverse a diffusion process to generate data. The diffusion process involves gradually adding noise to data until it becomes pure noise.\nThrough this process a simple distribution is transformed into a complex data distribution in a series of small incremental steps.\nEssentially these models operate as a reverse diffusion phenomenon where noise is introduced to the data in a forward manner and removed in a reverse manner to generate new data samples.\nBy learning to reverse this process diffusion models start from noise and gradually denoise it to produce data that closely resembles the training examples."

Language models play a crucial role in various NLP tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, text generation, and sentiment analysis. They analyze and understand the structure and use of human language, enabling machines to process and generate text that is contextually appropriate and coherent.\nLanguage models can be broadly categorized into two types:"
  },
  {
    "input": "Purpose and Functionality",
    "output": "The primary purpose of a language model is to capture the statistical properties of natural language. By learning the probability distribution of word sequences, a language model can predict the likelihood of a given word following a sequence of words. This predictive capability is fundamental for tasks that require understanding the context and meaning of text.\nFor instance, in text generation, a language model can generate plausible and contextually relevant text by predicting the next word in a sequence iteratively. In machine translation, language models help in translating text from one language to another by understanding and generating grammatically correct sentences in the target language."
  },
  {
    "input": "Pure Statistical Methods",

  },
  {
    "input": "1.N-grams",
    "output": "An n-gram is a sequence of n items from a sample of text or speech, such as phonemes, syllables, letters, words, or base pairs. N-gram models use the frequency of these sequences in a training corpus to predict the likelihood of word sequences. For example, a bigram (2-gram) model predicts the next word based on the previous word, while a trigram (3-gram) model uses the two preceding words.\nN-gram models are simple, easy to implement, and computationally efficient, making them suitable for applications with limited computational resources. However, they have significant limitations. They struggle with capturing long-range dependencies due to their limited context window. As n increases, the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially, leading to sparsity issues where many sequences are never observed in the training data. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately estimate the probabilities of less common sequences."
  },

    "input": "2. Exponential Models",
    "output": "Exponential models, such as the Maximum Entropy model, are more flexible and powerful than n-gram models. They predict the probability of a word based on a wide range of features, including not only the previous words but also other contextual information. These models assign weights to different features and combine them using an exponential function to estimate probabilities.\nMaximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models, also known as logistic regression in the context of classification, are used to estimate the probabilities of different outcomes based on a set of features. In the context of language modeling, MaxEnt models use features such as the presence of certain words, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic patterns to predict the next word. The model parameters are learned by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data under the model.\nMaxEnt models are more flexible than n-gram models because they can incorporate a wider range of features. However, they are also more complex and computationally intensive to train. Like n-gram models, MaxEnt models still struggle with long-range dependencies because they rely on fixed-length context windows."

The skip-gram model predicts the context words given a target word, while the CBOW model predicts the target word given the context words. Both models are trained using neural networks, but they are conceptually simple and computationally efficient."

Unlike RNNs, which process data sequentially, the Transformer model processes the entire input simultaneously, making it more efficient for parallel computation.\nThe key components of the Transformer architecture are:\nSelf-Attention Mechanism: This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence, capturing dependencies regardless of their distance in the text. Each word's representation is updated based on its relationship with all other words in the sequence.\nEncoder-Decoder Structure: The Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a set of hidden representations. The decoder takes these representations and generates the output sequence.\nPositional Encoding: Since Transformers do not process the input sequentially, they use positional encoding to retain information about the order of words in a sequence. This encoding adds positional information to the input embeddings, allowing the model to consider the order of words.\nSome of the transformers based models are - BERT, GPT-3, T5 and more."

It is commonly referred to as DALL-E is an artificial intelligence model developed byOpen AI, tailored to generate visual content in the form of images from textual prompts. But how does this remarkable model achieve such intricate tasks? The answer lies in its training regimen and underlying architecture.\n1. Training Dataset\nFor DALE-E to generate images from textual prompts, it's crucial for it to understand the relationship between text and visual content. To achieve this, the model is trained on a vast dataset containing images paired with their corresponding textual descriptions. This extensive dataset allows the model to learn how specific words and phrases correlate with visual features. For example, when exposed to multiple images of \"sunset by the beach,\" DALE-E learns to associate certain colors, shapes, and patterns with the textual description.\n2. Learning Process\nThe training process uses a method calledsupervised learning. Here's a step-by-step overview:\nInput-Output Pairs:DALL-E is presented with an image-text pair. The image acts as the desired output for the given text.\nPrediction: Based on its current understanding, DALL-E tries to generate an image from the text.\nError Calculation:The difference between DALL-E's generated image and the actual image (from the dataset) is measured. This difference is termed as \"error\" or \"loss.\"\nBackpropagation: Using this error, the model adjusts its internal parameters to reduce the error for subsequent predictions.\nIteration: Steps 2 to 4 are repeated millions of times, refining DALL-E's understanding with each iteration.\n3. Fine-tuning and Regularization\nTo preventoverfitting, where the model becomes too attuned to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data, regularization techniques are applied. Additionally, DALL-E might undergo fine-tuning, where it's trained on a more specific dataset after its initial broad training, to refine its capabilities for certain tasks or to better understand nuanced prompts."

    "output": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is one of the most widely used techniques in LLM distillation. In this approach, the student model is trained using the teacher model’s output probabilities know as soft targets along with the ground truth labels, referred to as hard targets. Soft targets provide a richer view of the teacher’s predictions, allowing the student to capture subtle patterns and complex knowledge encoded in the teacher. This enables the student to better understand the teacher’s decision-making process, improving accuracy and reliability while preserving essential knowledge.\nSoft targets offer a probability distribution over possible outputs instead of a single correct answer.\nHelps the student model capture intricate patterns and nuanced knowledge.\nLeads to more accurate and reliable student performance.\nFacilitates smoother and more effective training by preserving crucial teacher knowledge.\nSeveral other techniques are also used to enhance the LLM Distillation,\nData Augmentation: This involves generating extra training data using the teacher model. By expanding the dataset, the student is exposed to a wider variety of scenarios, improving generalization and robustness.\nIntermediate Layer Distillation: Rather than focusing solely on the final outputs, this method transfers knowledge from the intermediate layers of the teacher model. Learning from these intermediate representations allows the student to capture more detailed and structured information, boosting overall performance.\nMulti-Teacher Distillation: A student model can learn from multiple teacher models simultaneously. Aggregating knowledge from different teachers helps the student achieve a more comprehensive understanding and greater robustness by integrating diverse perspectives.\nFeature-Based Distillation: The student mimics intermediate hidden layer representations of the teacher. This is done by minimizing the difference (e.g., L2 loss) between corresponding internal activations.\nPrompt Distillation: This technique compresses long and complex prompts into shorter, efficient prompts while retaining their effectiveness. By capturing the core intent of the prompt, it reduces computation and speeds up inference.\nReinforcement Learning (RL) Based Distillation: Using teacher feedback as rewards to iteratively improve student outputs with reinforcement learning methods.\nTask-Specific Distillation: The student model is fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization) after distillation to improve performance on real-world applications."

The question arises how can we make sure that our prompt is right for the task at hand?Following are some key points one should remember while engineering a prompt for an AI model:\nBegin with Objectives and Goals:AI models often work based on manual input only. The raw input used to train a model or the running text or conversation one does with alanguage modelall affect how the model will reply to the next query. Hence, whenever interacting with a model, the goal of the conversation and the objectives to be achieved via it should be absolutely clear even before one begins.\nRelevant and Specific Data Identification and Usage: As clearly stated just like every prompt and its objective should be described clearly, similarly, only absolutely relevant data should be used to train a model. One should make sure there is no irrelevant or unnecessary data in the training.\nFocus on finding the Relevant Keywords: Relevant keywords, make a huge difference in the type of response generated. Akeywordused correctly in the right place can lead to a much different result altogether. For example, working on a mathematical problem, if someone asks a model: “What are planes?”, there can be a very high chance if the keyword “mathematics” is not mentioned, the AI will consider the word plane in the context of airplanes. Hence, keywords should be used wherever necessary!\nMake sure your prompts are simple and clear: When crafting prompts, it's important to keep them simple and clear by using plain language and avoiding overly complex sentence structures. This will make it easier for the model to generate accurate outputs and for users to understand the prompts.\nTest and Refine Your Prompts:The final step is to use a variety of test cases to evaluate the performance of the generated prompts and make adjustments as needed. Further refining the prompts based on the tests will improve the accuracy of the outputs generated by your model.\nBy following the above best practices, you can create prompts that are tailored to your specific objectives and generate accurate and useful outputs."

    "input": "How Text Analytics Work?",
    "output": "Text Analytics process typically includes several key steps, such as language identification,tokenization, sentence breaking, part-of-speech tagging,chunking, syntax parsing, and sentence chaining. Let's briefly explore each of these steps:"
  },
  {
    "input": "Language Identification",
    "output": "Objective:Determine the language in which the text is written.\nHow it works:Algorithms analyze patterns within the text to identify the language. This is essential for subsequent processing steps, as different languages may have different rules and structures."
  },
  {
    "input": "Tokenization",
    "output": "Objective:Divide the text into individual units, often words or sub-word units (tokens).\nHow it works:Tokenization breaks down the text into meaningful units, making it easier to analyze and process. It involves identifying word boundaries and handling punctuation."
  },
  {
    "input": "Sentence Breaking",
    "output": "Objective:Identify and separate individual sentences in the text.\nHow it works:Algorithms analyze the text to determine where one sentence ends and another begins. This is crucial for tasks that require understanding the context of sentences."
  },
  {
    "input": "Part of Speech Tagging",
    "output": "Objective:Assign a grammatical category (part of speech) to each token in a sentence.\nHow it works:Machine learning modelsor rule-based systems analyze the context and relationships between words to assign appropriate part-of-speech tags (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each token."
  },
  {
    "input": "Chunking",
    "output": "Objective:Identify and group related words (tokens) together, often based on the part-of-speech tags.\nHow it works:Chunking helps in identifying phrases or meaningful chunks within a sentence. This step is useful for extracting information about specific entities or relationships between words."
  },
  {
    "input": "Syntax Parsing",
    "output": "Objective:Analyze the grammatical structure of sentences to understand relationships between words.\nHow it works:Syntax parsing involves creating a syntactic tree that represents the grammatical structure of a sentence. This tree helps in understanding the syntactic relationships and dependencies between words."
  },
  {
    "input": "Sentence Chaining",
    "output": "Objective:Connect and understand the relationships between multiple sentences.\nHow it works:Algorithms analyze the content and context of different sentences to establish connections or dependencies between them. This step is crucial for tasks that require a broader understanding of the text, such as summarization or document-level sentiment analysis.\nOverall, text analytics involves a combination of linguistic rules, machine learning models, and statistical techniques to extract valuable information from text data. The specific techniques and tools used may vary depending on the application and the complexity of the text analysis task."
