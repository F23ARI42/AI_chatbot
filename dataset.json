    "output": "Abductive reasoningis a type of reasoning that emphasizes drawing inferences from the existing data. There is no assurance that the conclusion drawn is accurate, though, as the information at hand could not be comprehensive. Conclusions drawn from abductive reasoning are likely to be true. This type of reasoning determines the most likely conclusion for a set of incomplete facts by taking it into account. Although abductive reasoning is a kind of deductive reasoning, the accuracy of the conclusion cannot be guaranteed by the information at hand."

Memory:Agents typically have multiple types of memory:\nShort‑term memory for the current interaction\nLong‑term memory for storing historical data and conversations\nEpisodic memory for recalling specific past events\nConsensus memory for sharing knowledge among multiple agents\nMemory enables an agent to keep context, learn from experience and adapt its behaviour over time.\n3. Tools:These are functions or external resources the agent can use to access information, process data, control devices or connect with other systems. Tools may involve physical interfaces, graphical UIs or programmatic APIs. Agents also learn how and when to use these tools effectively, based on their capabilities and context.\n4.

The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error.
