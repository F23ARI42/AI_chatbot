Memory:Agents typically have multiple types of memory:\nShort‑term memory for the current interaction\nLong‑term memory for storing historical data and conversations\nEpisodic memory for recalling specific past events\nConsensus memory for sharing knowledge among multiple agents\nMemory enables an agent to keep context, learn from experience and adapt its behaviour over time.\n3. Tools:These are functions or external resources the agent can use to access information, process data, control devices or connect with other systems. Tools may involve physical interfaces, graphical UIs or programmatic APIs. Agents also learn how and when to use these tools effectively, based on their capabilities and context.\n4. Model:Agents use large language model (LLM) which serves as the agent’s “brain”.

The network processes these images and learns to identify the features that define a cat.\nOnce the network has been trained, we test it by providing new images to see if it can correctly identify cats. The network’s prediction is then compared to the actual label (whether it's a cat or not). If it makes an incorrect prediction, the network adjusts by fine-tuning the weights of the connections between neurons using a process called backpropagation. This involves correcting the weights based on the difference between the predicted and actual result.\nThis process repeats until the network can accurately recognize a cat in an image with minimal error. Essentially, through constant training and feedback, the network becomes better at identifying patterns and making predictions."

    "output": "Consider a maze as our environment, where an agent's goal is to reach the trophy state (rewardR = 1) while avoiding the fire state (rewardR = -1). The agent receives positive reinforcement for reaching the goal and negative reinforcement for failing. The agent must navigate the maze efficiently while considering possible future rewards.\nWhat Happens Without the Bellman Equation?\nInitially we allow the agent to explore the environment and find a path to the goal. Once it reaches the trophy state it backtracks to its starting position and assigns a value of V = 1 to all states that lead to the goal.\nHowever if we change the agent’s starting position it will struggle to find a new path since all previously learned state values remain the same. This is where the Bellman Equation helps by dynamically updating state values based on future rewards.\nApplying the Concept\nConsider a state adjacent to the fire state, where V = 0.9. The agent can move UP, DOWN or RIGHT but cannot move LEFT due to a wall. Among the available actions the agent selects the action leading to the maximum value, ensuring the highest possible reward over time.\nBy continuously updating state values the agent systematically calculates the best path while avoiding the fire state. The goal (trophy) and failure (fire) states do not require value updates as they represent terminal states (V = 0). Bellman Equation allows agents to think ahead, balance immediate and future rewards and choose actions wisely."

Branching Based on Answers:Each question leads to different branches:\nIf the answer is yes, the tree follows one path.\nIf the answer is no, the tree follows another path.\n4. Continue Splitting:This branching continues through further decisions helps in reducing the data down step-by-step.\n5. Reach the Leaf Node:The process ends when there are no more useful questions to ask leading to the leaf node where the final decision or prediction is made.\nLet’s look at a simple example to understand how it works. Imagine we need to decide whether to drink coffee based on the time of day and how tired we feel. The tree first checks the time:\n1. In the morning: It asks “Tired?”\nIf yes, the tree suggests drinking coffee.\nIf no, it says no coffee is needed.\n2.

However they often face challenges in learning long-term dependencies where information from distant time steps becomes crucial for making accurate predictions for current state.

This makes it hard for the model to learn long-term patterns since earlier information becomes almost irrelevant.\nExploding Gradient: Sometimes gradients can grow too large causing instability.

Instead of just R, G, and B channels now we have more channels but lesser width and height. This operation is calledConvolution.

The possible size of filters can be axax3, where ‘a’ can be anything like 3, 5, or 7 but smaller as compared to the image dimension.\nDuring the forward pass, we slide each filter across the whole input volume step by step where each step is calledstride(which can have a value of 2, 3, or even 4 for high-dimensional images) and compute the dot product between the kernel weights and patch from input volume.\nAs we slide our filters we’ll get a 2-D output for each filter and we’ll stack them together as a result, we’ll get output volume having a depth equal to the number of filters.

In CNN, Generally, the input will be an image or a sequence of images. This layer holds the raw input of the image with width 32, height 32, and depth 3.\nConvolutional Layers:This is the layer, which is used to extract the feature from the input dataset. It applies a set of learnable filters known as the kernels to the input images. The filters/kernels are smaller matrices usually 2x2, 3x3, or 5x5 shape. it slides over the input image data and computes the dot product between kernel weight and the corresponding input image patch. The output of this layer is referred as feature maps. Suppose we use a total of 12 filters for this layer we’ll get an output volume of dimension 32 x 32 x 12.\nActivation Layer: By adding an activation function to the output of the preceding layer, activation layers add nonlinearity to the network. it will apply an element-wise activation function to the output of the convolution layer. Some common activation functions areRELU: max(0, x),Tanh,Leaky RELU, etc. The volume remains unchanged hence output volume will have dimensions 32 x 32 x 12.\nPooling layer: This layer is periodically inserted in the covnets and its main function is to reduce the size of volume which makes the computation fast reduces memory and also prevents overfitting. Two common types of pooling layers aremax poolingandaverage pooling. If we use a max pool with 2 x 2 filters and stride 2, the resultant volume will be of dimension 16x16x12.\n\nFlattening:The resulting feature maps are flattened into a one-dimensional vector after the convolution and pooling layers so they can be passed into a completely linked layer for categorization or regression.\nFully Connected Layers:It takes the input from the previous layer and computes the final classification or regression task.\nOutput Layer:The output from the fully connected layers is then fed into a logistic function for classification tasks like sigmoid or softmax which converts the output of each class into the probability score of each class."

Each state can have one or more possible actions.\n3.Transition Model (T): The model tells us what happens when an action is taken in a state. It’s like asking: “If I move RIGHT from here, where will I land?” Sometimes the outcome isn’t always the same that’s uncertainty. For example:\n80% chance of moving in the intended direction\n10% chance of slipping to the left\n10% chance of slipping to the right\nThis randomness is called astochastic transition.\n4.Reward (R): A reward is a number given to the agent after it takes an action. If the reward is positive, it means the result of the action was good. If the reward is negative it means the outcome was bad or there was a penalty help the agent learn what’s good or bad. Examples:\n+1 for reaching the goal\n-1 for stepping into fire\n-0.1 for each step to encourage fewer moves\n5.Policy (π): A policy is the agent’s plan. It tells the agent: “If you are in this state, take this action.” The goal is to find the best policy that helps the agent earn the highest total reward over time.\nLet’s consider a 3x4 grid world.

It is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in supervised learning.\nLogistic Regression: Logistic regression is a type of supervised learning classification algorithm that is used to predict a binary output variable.\nDecision Trees: Decision tree is a tree-like structure that is used to model decisions and their possible consequences. Each internal node in the tree represents a decision, while each leaf node represents a possible outcome.\nRandom Forests: Random forests again are made up of multiple decision trees that work together to make predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a different subset of the input features and data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees in the forest.\nSupport Vector Machine(SVM):The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.\nK-Nearest Neighbors:KNN works by finding k training examples closest to a given input and then predicts the class or value based on the majority class or average value of these neighbors. The performance of KNN can be influenced by the choice of k and the distance metric used to measure proximity.\nGradient Boosting:Gradient Boosting combines weak learners, like decision trees, to create a strong model. It iteratively builds new models that correct errors made by previous ones.\nNaive Bayes Algorithm:The Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm based on applying Bayes' Theorem with the “naive” assumption that features are independent of each other given the class label.\nLet's summarize the supervised machine learning algorithms in table:\nThese types of supervised learning in machine learning vary based on the problem we're trying to solve and the dataset we're working with.

This allows SVM to work efficiently with non-linear data by implicitly performing the mapping. For example consider data points that are not linearly separable. By applying a kernel function SVM transforms the data points into a higher-dimensional space where they become linearly separable.\nLinear Kernel: For linear separability.\nPolynomial Kernel: Maps data into a polynomial space.\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel: Transforms data into a space based on distances between data points.\nIn this case the new variable y is created as a function of distance from the origin."

Modern machine learning algorithms rely heavily on SGD because, despite its simplicity, it may be quite effective when combined with regularization strategies and suitable learning rate schedules."

  {
    "input": "Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm",
    "output": "For machine learning model training, initializing model parameters (θ) and selecting a low learning rate (α) are the first steps in performing stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Next, to add unpredictability, the training data is jumbled at random. Every time around, the algorithm analyzes a single training sample and determines thecost function's gradient (J) in relation to the model's parameters. The size and direction of the steepest slope are represented by this gradient. The model is adjusted to minimize the cost function and provide predictions that are more accurate by updating θ in the gradient's opposite direction. The model can efficiently learn from and adjust to new information by going through these iterative processes for every data point.\nThe cost function,J(\\theta), is typically a function of the difference between the predicted valueh_{\\theta}(x)and the actual targety. In regression problems, it's often themean squared error; in classification problems, it can be cross-entropy loss, for example.\nFor Regression (Mean Squared Error):\nCost Function:\nJ(θ) =\\frac{1}{2m}* \\sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{θ}(x^i) - y^i)^2\nGradient (Partial Derivatives):\n∇J(θ) = \\frac{1}{m}*\\sum_{i=1}^m(h_{\\theta}(x^i) - y^i)x_{j}^i for\\;\\;\\; j = 0 \\to n\nUpdate Parameters\nUpdate the model parameters (θ) based on the gradient and the learning rate:\n\\theta = \\theta -\\alpha * \\nabla J(\\theta)\nwhere,\nθ: Updated model parameters.\nα: Learning rate.\n∇J(θ): Gradient vector computed."

  },
  {
    "input": "How it Differs from Other Classifiers:",
    "output": "The SGD Classifier differs from other classifiers in several ways:\nStochastic Gradient Descent:Unlike some classifiers that use closed-form solutions orbatch gradient descent(which processes the entire training dataset in each iteration), the SGD Classifier uses stochastic gradient descent. It updates the model's parameters incrementally, processing one training example at a time or in small mini-batches. This makes it computationally efficient and well-suited for large datasets.\nLinearity:The SGD Classifier is a linear classifier, meaning it constructs a linear decision boundary to separate classes. This makes it suitable for problems where the relationship between features and the target variable is approximately linear. In contrast, algorithms like decision trees or support vector machines can capture more complex decision boundaries.\nRegularization:The SGD Classifier allows for the incorporation ofL1 or L2 regularizationto prevent overfitting. Regularization terms are added to the cost function, encouraging the model to have smaller parameter values. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data."

    "input": "Parameters of Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier",
    "output": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier is a versatile algorithm with various parameters and concepts that can significantly impact its performance. Here's a detailed explanation of some of the key parameters and concepts relevant to the SGD Classifier:\n1. Learning Rate (α):\nThelearning rate(α) is a crucial hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken during parameter updates in each iteration.\nIt controls the trade-off between convergence speed and stability.\nA larger learning rate can lead to faster convergence but may result in overshooting the optimal solution.\nIn contrast, a smaller learning rate may lead to slower convergence but with more stable updates.\nIt's important to choose an appropriate learning rate for your specific problem.\n2. Batch Size:\nThe batch size defines the number of training examples used in each iteration or mini-batch when updating the model parameters. There are three common choices for batch size:\nStochastic Gradient Descent (batch size = 1):In this case, the model parameters are updated after processing each training example. This introduces significant randomness and can help escape local minima but may result in noisy updates.\nMini-Batch Gradient Descent (1 < batch size < number of training examples):Mini-batch SGDstrikes a balance between the efficiency of batch gradient descent and the noise of stochastic gradient descent. It's the most commonly used variant.\nBatch Gradient Descent (batch size = number of training examples):In this case, the model parameters are updated using the entire training dataset in each iteration. While this can lead to more stable updates, it is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n3. Convergence Criteria:\nConvergence criteria are used to determine when the optimization process should stop. Common convergence criteria include:\nFixed Number of Epochs:You can set a predefined number of epochs, and the algorithm stops after completing that many iterations through the dataset.\nTolerance on the Change in the Cost Function:Stop when the change in the cost function between consecutive iterations becomes smaller than a specified threshold.\nValidation Set Performance:You can monitor the performance of the model on a separate validation set and stop training when it reaches a satisfactory level of performance.\n4. Regularization (L1 and L2):\nRegularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting.\nThe SGD Classifier allows you to incorporate L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms into the cost function.\nThese terms add a penalty based on the magnitude of the model parameters, encouraging them to be small.\nThe regularization strength hyperparameter controls the impact of regularization on the optimization process.\n5. Loss Function:\nThe choice of theloss functiondetermines how the classifier measures the error between predicted and actual class labels.\nFor binary classification, the cross-entropy loss is commonly used, while for multi-class problems, the categorical cross-entropy or softmax loss is typical.\nThe choice of the loss function should align with the problem and the activation function used.\n6. Momentum and Adaptive Learning Rates:\nTo enhance convergence and avoid oscillations, you can use momentum techniques or adaptive learning rates. Momentum introduces an additional parameter that smoothers the updates and helps the algorithm escape local minima.Adaptive learning ratemethods automatically adjust the learning rate during training based on the observed progress.\n7. Early Stopping:\nEarly stoppingis a technique used to prevent overfitting. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the optimization process when the performance starts to degrade, indicating overfitting."

The data is then split 70–30 for training and testing purposes, with a reproducible random seed of 42. This yields training and testing sets for both features and labels.\nAn SGD Classifier (clf) is instantiated for classification tasks in this code. Because the classifier is configured to use the log loss (logistic loss) function, it can be used for both binary and multiclass classification. Furthermore, to help avoid overfitting, L2 regularization is used with an alpha parameter of 0.01. To guarantee consistency of results, a random seed of 42 is chosen, and the classifier is programmed to run up to 1000 iterations during training.\nUsing the training data (X_train and y_train), these lines of code train the SGD Classifier (clf). Following training, the model is applied to generate predictions on the test data (X_test), which are then saved in the y_pred variable for a future analysis.\nOutput:\nThese lines of code compare the predicted labels (y_pred) with the actual labels of the test data (y_test) to determine the classification accuracy. To assess the performance of the model, theaccuracyscore is displayed on the console.\nOutput:\n\n\nWith the help of the Seaborn library, these lines of code visualize theconfusion matrixas a heatmap. The counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions are all included in the conf_matrix. The values are labeled on the heatmap, and the target class names are set for the x and y labels. At last, the plot gets a title, which is then shown. Understanding the model's performance in each class is made easier with the help of this representation.\nOutput:\n\n\nFor the two classes Setosa and Versicolor in the Iris dataset, this code generates ascatter plotto show the relationship between Sepal Length and Sepal Width. Plotting the data points for each class with unique markers (circles for Setosa and crosses for Versicolor) is done using the plt.scatter function. To enhance the plot's visual appeal and informativeness, x and y-axis labels, a legend, and a title are added.\nOutput:\nUsing the classification_report function, this code generates theclassification reportfor the actual labels (y_test) and the predicted results (y_pred), which includes multiple classification metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

This makes it suitable for scenarios with massive amounts of data.\nOnline Learning:SGD is well-suited for online learning, where the model can adapt and learn from incoming data streams in real-time. It can continuously update its parameters, making it useful for applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, and clickstream analysis.\nQuick Convergence:SGD often converges faster than batch gradient descent because of the more frequent parameter updates. This speed can be beneficial when you have computational constraints or want to quickly iterate through different model configurations.\nRegularization Support:The SGD Classifier allows for the incorporation of L1 and L2 regularization terms, which help prevent overfitting.

If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm may overshoot the optimal solution, while too low of a learning rate can lead to slow convergence. Finding the right balance can be time-consuming.\nSensitivity to Feature Scaling:SGD is sensitive to feature scaling. Features should ideally be standardized (i.e., mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) to ensure optimal convergence. Failure to do so can lead to convergence issues.\nLimited Modeling Capabilities:Being a linear classifier, the SGD Classifier may struggle with complex data that doesn't have a linear decision boundary. In such cases, other algorithms like decision trees or neural networks might be more suitable."

A linear model often results in residuals with noticeable patterns which shows a poor fit. It can capture these non-linear patterns effectively.\nFlexibility and Complexity:It does not assume all independent variables are independent. By introducing higher-degree terms, it allows for more flexibility and can model more complex, curvilinear relationships between variables."

In simple linear regression, this relationship is modeled as:\ny = a + bx + e\nHere\nyis a dependent variable\nais the y-intercept,bis the slope\neis the error term\nHowever in cases where the relationship between the variables is nonlinear such as modelling chemical synthesis based on temperature, a linear model may not be sufficient. Instead, we use polynomial regression which introduces higher-degree terms such asx ^2to better capture the relationship.\nFor example, a quadratic model can be written as:\ny = a + b_1x + b_2x^2 + e\nHere:\nyis the dependent variable onx\nais the y-intercept andeis the error rate.\nIn general, polynomial regression can be extended to the nth degree:\ny = a + b_1x + b_2x^2 +....+ b_nx^n\nWhile the regression function is linear in terms of the unknown coefficients𝑏_0,𝑏_1,…,𝑏_𝑛, the model itself captures non-linear patterns in the data. The coefficients are estimated using techniques like Least Square technique to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.\nChoosing the right polynomial degreenis important: a higher degree may fit the data more closely but it can lead to overfitting. The degree should be selected based on the complexity of the data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data, capturing non-linear relationships and providing a more accurate model for real-world applications."

    "input": "How Ridge RegressionAddresses Overfitting and Multicollinearity?",
    "output": "Overfittingoccurs when a model becomes too complex and fits the noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization on new data. Ridge regression combats overfitting by adding a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function.\nThis penalty discourages the model from using large values for the coefficients (the numbers multiplying the features). It forces the model to keep these coefficients small.  By making the coefficients smaller and closer to zero, ridge regression simplifies the model and reduces its sensitivity to random fluctuations or noise in the data. This makes the model less likely to overfit and helps it perform better on new, unseen data, improving its overall accuracy and reliability.\nFor Example- We are predicting house prices based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and age of the house:\nPrice=1000 Size−500⋅Age+Noise\nRidge might adjust it to:\nPrice=800⋅Size−300⋅Age+Less Noise\nAs lambda increases the modelplaces more emphasis on shrinking the coefficients of highly correlated features, making their impact smaller and more stable. This reduces the effect of multicollinearity by preventing large fluctuations in coefficient estimates due to correlated predictors."

The ridge regression estimator is:\n\\hat{\\beta}_k = (X'X + kI)^{-1}X'y\nThis modification stabilizes the estimates by shrinking the coefficients, improving generalization and mitigating multicollinearity effects."

The following simulation illustrates how the variation in β is affected by different penalty values, showing how estimated parameters deviate from the true values.\nRidge regression introduces bias into the estimates to reduce their variance. Themean squared error (MSE)of the ridge estimator can be decomposed into bias and variance components:\n\\text{MSE}(\\hat{\\beta}_k) = \\text{Bias}^2(\\hat{\\beta}_k) + \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_k)\nBias: Measures the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be complex, by a simplified model. In ridge regression, as the regularization parameter k increases, the model becomes simpler, which increases bias but reduces variance.\nVariance: Measures how much the ridge regression model's predictions would vary if we used different training data. As the regularization parameter k decreases, the model becomes more complex, fitting the training data more closely, which reduces bias but increases variance.\nIrreducible Error: Represents the noise in the data that cannot be reduced by any model.\nAs k increases, the bias increases, but the variance decreases.

This analysis does not take into account third-party influence.For example,the correlation between the yield per acre of grain and jute can be of a high degree because both are linked to the amount of rainfall. However, in reality, both these variables do not have any effect on each other.\nIt may be challenging to determine which is the cause, and which is the effect when two variables indicate a high degree of correlation. It is so because they may be having an impact on one another.For example,when there is an increase in the price of a commodity, it increases its demand. Here, the price is the cause, and demand is the effect. However, there is a possibility that the price of the commodity will rise due to increased demand (population growth or other factors). In that case, increased demand is the cause, and the price is the effect.\nIt is possible that the correlation between the two variables was obtained by random chance or coincidence alone. This correlation is also known asspurious. Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether there is a possibility of a relationship between the variables under analysis.For example,even if there is no relationship between the two variables (between the income of people in a society and their clothes size), one may see a strong correlation between them.\nSo, it can be said that correlation provides only a quantitative measure and does not indicates cause and effect relationship between the variables.

In this case, each epoch would consist of 10 iterations with each iteration processing one batch of 100 samples.\nTypically, when training a model, the number of epochs is set to a large number like 100 and anearly stoppingmethod is used to determine when to stop training.

This approach ensures that the model is not exposed to any information from the validation set during training, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the cross-validation process.\nThe necessity to fit the encoder on the training folds and not on the validation fold in each cross-validation step is to prevent overfitting and data leakage.\nIf the encoder is fit on the entire dataset, including the validation set, it can lead to the model being biased towards the validation set, resulting in overfitting.\nNested cross-validation is a robust technique to mitigate data leakage and ensure unbiased model evaluation.

    "output": "Implementing target encoding within nested cross-validation demands careful attention to various considerations and adherence to best practices. Common pitfalls and offer guidance on best practices for maximizing the effectiveness of this technique:\nChoosing Appropriate Encoding Techniques: Different categorical variables may require different encoding techniques. For ordinal variables, methods like ordinal encoding might be suitable, while for nominal variables, techniques like target encoding or one-hot encoding could be considered. Understanding the nature of the categorical variables in your dataset is crucial for selecting the most appropriate encoding method.\nHandling Missing Values During Encoding: Missing values within categorical variables pose a challenge during encoding. It's essential to decide how to handle these missing values before applying target encoding. Options include treating missing values as a separate category, imputing them with the mode or median, or using advanced imputation techniques. The chosen approach should align with the specific characteristics of the dataset and the objectives of the analysis.\nDealing with Rare or Unseen Categories: In real-world datasets, categorical variables may contain rare or unseen categories that were not present in the training data. Target encoding such categories based solely on the training set may lead to biased or unreliable results. To address this issue, consider techniques such as frequency thresholding or combining rare categories into a single group. Additionally, incorporating domain knowledge or external data sources can aid in properly handling rare categories during encoding.\nPreventing Overfitting and Data Leakage: Overfitting and data leakage are significant concerns when using target encoding within nested cross-validation. To mitigate these risks, ensure that the encoding is performed solely on the training folds during cross-validation. This prevents information from the validation set from influencing the encoding process, leading to more reliable model evaluation. By adhering to this practice, the model can generalize better to unseen data and provide more accurate performance estimates."

Overfitting happens when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data, usually due to the model being too complex. This results in low training error but higher test error.\nTo prevent overfitting, regularization techniques are used to help the model focus on learning meaningful patterns instead of memorizing the training data.Early stoppingis one such technique that stops training once the model shows signs of overfitting and ensures it generalizes better to new data."

It prevents the model from performing well on the training set but underperforming on unseen data i.e validation set. Training stops when performance improves on the training set but degrades on the validation set, promoting better generalization while saving time and resources.\nThe technique monitors the model’s performance on both the training and validation sets. If the validation performance worsens, training stops and the model retains the best weights from the period of optimal validation performance.\n\nEarly stopping is an efficient method when training data is limited as it typically requires fewer epochs than other techniques.

This allows the model to learn more complex data patterns and model intricate relationships between features.\nSparse Activation:ReLU's ability to output zero for negative inputs introduces sparsity in the network, meaning that only a fraction of neurons activate at any given time. This can lead to more efficient and faster computation.\nGradient Computation:ReLU offers computational advantages in terms of backpropagation, as its derivative is simple—either 0 (when the input is negative) or 1 (when the input is positive).

How well this line captures the trend in the data depends on the complexity of the model you use.\nWhen a model is too simple, like fitting a straight line to curved data, it hashigh biasand fails to capture the true relationship, leading tounderfitting. For example, a linear model cannot represent a non-linear increase in house prices with size.\nHowever, if the model becomes too complex, like a fourth-degree polynomial that adjusts to every point, it developshigh variance, overfits the training data, and struggles to generalize to new data. This isoverfitting, where the model performs well on training but poorly on testing.\nAn ideal model strikes a balance withlow bias and low variance, capturing the overall pattern without overreacting to noise.

This means the presence of one word doesn't affect the presence of another word which makes the model easy to use.\nThe model looks at how many times each word appears in messages from different categories (like \"spam\" or \"not spam\"). For example if the word \"free\" appears often in spam messages that will be used to help predict whether a new message is spam or not.\nTo calculate the probability of a message belonging to a certain category Multinomial Naive Bayes uses themultinomial distribution:\nWhere:\nn is the total number of trials.\nn_iis the count of occurrences for outcome i.\np_iis the probability of outcome i.\nTo estimate how likely each word is in a particular class like \"spam\" or \"not spam\" we use a method calledMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).This helps finding probabilities based on actual counts from our data.

Consider the following data:\nThe above-given data is a hypothetical dataset of transactions with each letter representing an item. The frequency of each individual item is computed:-\nLet the minimum support be 3. AFrequent Pattern setis built which will contain all the elements whose frequency is greater than or equal to the minimum support. These elements are stored in descending order of their respective frequencies. After insertion of the relevant items, the set L looks like this:-L = {K : 5, E : 4, M : 3, O : 4, Y : 3}Now for each transaction the respectiveOrdered-Item setis built. It is done by iterating the Frequent Pattern set and checking if the current item is contained in the transaction in question. If the current item is contained the item is inserted in the Ordered-Item set for the current transaction. The following table is built for all the transactions:\nNow all the Ordered-Item sets are inserted into a Tree Data Structure.a) Inserting the set {K, E, M, O, Y}Here all the items are simply linked one after the other in the order of occurrence in the set and initialise the support count for each item as 1. For inserting {K, E, M, O, Y} we traverse the tree from the root. If a node already exists for an item, we increase its support count. If it doesn’t exist, we create a new node for that item and link it to the previous item.\nb) Inserting the set {K, E, O, Y}Till the insertion of the elements K and E, simply the support count is increased by 1. On inserting O we can see that there is no direct link between E and O, therefore a new node for the item O is initialized with the support count as 1 and item E is linked to this new node. On inserting Y, we first initialize a new node for the item Y with support count as 1 and link the new node of O with the new node of Y.\nc) Inserting the set {K, E, M}Here simply the support count of each element is increased by 1.\nd) Inserting the set {K, M, Y}Similar to step b), first the support count of K is increased, then new nodes for M and Y are initialized and linked accordingly.\n\ne) Inserting the set {K, E, O}Here simply the support counts of the respective elements are increased. Note that the support count of the new node of item O is increased.\nThe Conditional Pattern Base for each item consists of the set of prefixes of all paths in the FP-tree that lead to that item. Note that the items in the below table are arranged in the ascending order of their frequencies.\nNow for each item, theConditional Frequent Pattern Tree is built.It is done by taking the set of elements that is common in all the paths in the Conditional Pattern Base of that item and calculating its support count by summing the support counts of all the paths in the Conditional Pattern Base.\nFrom the Conditional Frequent Pattern tree theFrequent Pattern rulesare generated by pairing the items of the Conditional Frequent Pattern Tree set to the corresponding to the item as given in the below table.\nFor each row two types of association rules can be inferred for example for the first row which contains the element, the rulesK -> Y and Y -> Kcan be inferred. To determine the valid rule, the confidence of both the rules is calculated and the one with confidence greater than or equal to the minimum confidence value is retained.\nFrequent Pattern Growth (FP-Growth) algorithm improves upon the Apriori algorithm by eliminating the need for multiple database scans and reducing computational overhead. By using a Tree data structure and focusing on ordered-item sets it efficiently mines frequent item sets making it a faster and more scalable solution for large datasets making it useful tool for data mining."

It defines where the cluster is centered.\nCovariance (Σ):The covariance matrix describes the shape, size and orientation of the cluster. Unlike simpler clustering methods such as K-Means which assume spherical (circular) clusters, the covariance allows Gaussian components to take on elliptical shapes. This means clusters can be stretched, compressed or tilted depending on the relationships between features.\nTo visualize these concepts, consider two sets of data points generated from two Gaussians with different means and covariances:\nScatter plots show the raw data points clustered around their respective means.\nOverlaidkernel density estimate(KDE) contours represent the smooth shape of each Gaussian, illustrating the cluster’s distribution and spread.\nThis visualization highlights the flexibility of GMMs to model clusters that are not necessarily spherical and can overlap, making them more powerful than simpler methods like K-Means that assume equally sized, spherical clusters. By adjusting the mean and covariance, GMM adapts to the true underlying data distribution more accurately."

These values represent the likelihood of the point belonging to each cluster. Unlike hard clustering, a point can partially belong to multiple clusters simultaneously.\nFor example, for 2 clusters and 4 data points, an initial membership matrix (\\gamma) might look like:\nStep 2: Compute Cluster Centroids:Cluster centroids are calculated as the weighted average of all data points, where weights are the membership values raised to the fuzziness parameter m. Points with higher membership influence centroids more.\nThe centroid coordinatev_{ij}for clusteriand featurejis:\nWhere:\n\\gamma_{ik}​ = membership of point k in clusteri.\nm= fuzziness parameter (usually 2).\nx_{kj}​ = value of feature j for pointk.\nStep 3: Calculate Distance Between Data Points and Centroids:Compute the Euclidean distance between each point and every centroid to determine proximity, which will be used to update memberships. Example for point (1,3):\nSimilarly the distance of all other points is computed from both the centroids.\nStep 4: Update Membership Values:Membership values are updated inversely proportional to these distances. Points closer to a centroid get higher membership.\nUpdated membership\\gamma_{ik}for point k in clusteriis:\nStep 5: Repeat Until Convergence:Steps 2–4 are repeated until the membership values stabilize meaning there are no significant changes from one iteration to the next. This indicates that the clustering has reached an optimal state."

If we try to separate these classes with a straight line it can't be done because the data is not linearly separable in its current form.\nWhen we use a kernel function it transforms the original 2D data like the concentric circles into a higher-dimensional space where the data becomes linearly separable. In that higher-dimensional space the SVM finds a simple straight-line decision boundary to separate the classes.\nWhen we bring this straight-line decision boundary back to the original 2D space it no longer looks like a straight line.

If the dataset contains unusually high values (like a few people earning extremely high incomes) it may distort the results.

If the data is already normally distributed, calculating skewness isn't necessary, as it will be close to zero, offering little additional information.\nExample scenario:A retail analyst might use skewness to analyze monthly sales data for a product.

High kurtosis might signal that we need to pay attention to outliers, or that the data might be prone to extreme values that could affect the performance of certain models.\nNot suitable: For normal data, where the tails are not of particular interest. If a dataset is already fairly well-behaved with a near-normal distribution, kurtosis might not provide additional value.\nExample scenario:A risk manager analyzing daily stock returns might calculate kurtosis to identify potential for extreme loss days.

It reduces the influence of extreme outliers by compressing large values.\nBest used:The log transformation is particularly useful for data that exhibits large positive skew or exponential growth, such as income or population data. For example, applying a log transformation to income data can make the distribution more symmetric and reduce the effect of extreme income values.\nNot suitable:It’s not effective for data that already follows a normal distribution or doesn’t exhibit strong skewness. For such data, applying a log transformation could unnecessarily distort the data.\nExample:If we have a dataset of household incomes, we might apply a log transformation to make the distribution more symmetric, as incomes are often highly skewed with a few extremely high-income outliers."

    "input": "5.2. Polynomial Features",
    "output": "Polynomial features create new features by combining existing ones through polynomial terms, such as squares or cubes. This allows linear models to capture non-linear relationships.\nBest used:Polynomial features are useful when there’s a non-linear relationship between the features and the target variable. For instance, if we're modeling house prices, adding polynomial features like square or cubic terms of the square footage can help capture non-linear relationships.\nNot suitable:When the relationship between the features and the target is inherently linear. Polynomial features can lead to overfitting in such cases, especially if the degree of the polynomial is too high.\nExample:If we're predicting house prices and there’s a non-linear relationship between the square footage of a house and its price, adding polynomial features (e.g., square footage squared) can help capture that complexity."
  },
  {
    "input": "5.3. Interaction Features",
    "output": "Interaction features are created by combining two or more features to capture the combined effect that they might have on the target variable. These features are valuable when we believe that the impact of one feature depends on the value of another feature.\nBest used:Interaction features are particularly useful when we suspect that two features together have a joint effect on the target variable. For example, combining age and income might reveal an interaction effect on the likelihood of purchasing luxury items.\nNot suitable:Overuse of interaction features can lead to overfitting, especially if we add too many combinations without proper justification. It's important to add only those interactions that have meaningful, interpretable impacts.\nExample:A retailer could create an interaction feature between age and income to model the likelihood of purchasing high-end electronics. Younger consumers with high incomes might behave differently from older consumers with similar incomes and the interaction term would capture this nuanced relationship."

  {
    "input": "6.1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
    "output": "PCA is a linear technique that reduces the dimensionality of data by transforming the original features into a smaller set of uncorrelated features called principal components. These components capture the maximum variance in the data.\nBest used:PCA is useful when we want to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of the variability in the data. For example, PCA can be applied to financial data to reduce multiple correlated variables (such as stock returns) into fewer principal components that capture the majority of the variance.\nNot suitable:PCA is not effective for datasets where the features are non-linearly related, as it only captures linear relationships. Additionally, it’s not ideal if the data contains categorical variables that can’t be easily represented in a continuous space.\nExample:In a dataset with a large number of features representing customer behavior in an e-commerce platform, PCA can help reduce the dimensions and create new features (principal components) that capture the main patterns in customer behavior."

    "output": "t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that’s particularly effective for visualizing high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. It works by modeling pairwise similarities between points in high-dimensional space and attempting to preserve these similarities in lower-dimensional space.\nBest used: t-SNE is most useful for visualizing high-dimensional data, such as clustering results or complex datasets. It can help uncover patterns or clusters that are not easily visible in higher dimensions. For example, we might use t-SNE to visualize the clusters of customers based on their purchasing behavior.\nNot suitable: t-SNE is computationally expensive and can struggle with very large datasets. It also doesn’t preserve global relationships, so it might distort distances between data points, making it unsuitable for tasks requiring precise relationships.\nExample:In a dataset containing features like customer age, income and purchase history, t-SNE could be used to visualize how customers cluster based on purchasing behavior in a two-dimensional plot, helping us identify customer segments."

UMAP works by constructing a graph of the data and then embedding it in a lower-dimensional space while maintaining as much of the original data’s structure as possible.\nBest used:UMAP is ideal for visualizing high-dimensional data and is especially useful for large datasets. It can preserve both the local and global structure of the data, making it suitable for tasks like clustering, classification, or anomaly detection. For example, UMAP is often used in genomics or image analysis to reduce the dimensionality of gene expression data or image feature vectors.\nNot suitable:Like t-SNE, UMAP can distort data points’ exact distances, so it’s not suitable for tasks requiring precise distance metrics. It also requires careful tuning of hyperparameters to get optimal results.\nExample:A data scientist might use UMAP to visualize the features of customer interactions with an online store, reducing high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions to uncover trends or clusters that might indicate potential marketing strategies."

To build and train our model we use the following code:\nNow that we have our model ready we need to define the format of the data we are going to provide to our model to make the predictions. This step is import because our model works on numerical data, and we don't want to feed the data of any other type to our model, in order to do this we need to validate that the data we receive follows that norm.\nThe Request Body:\nThe data sent from the client side to the API is called arequest body.The data sent from API to the client is called aresponse body.\nTo define ourrequest bodywe'll use BaseModel ,inpydanticmodule, and define the format of the data we'll send to the API. To define ourrequest body,we'll create a class that inherits BaseModel and define the features as the attributes of that class along with their type hints. What pydantic does is that it defines these type hints during runtime and generates an error when data is invalid. So let's create our request_body class:-\nNow that we have a request body all that's left to do is to add an endpoint that'll predict the class and return it as a response :\nAnd there we have our ML model deployed as an API. Now all that's left to do is test it out.\nTesting our API:\nTo test our API we'll be using Swagger UI now to access that you'll just need to add/docsat the end of your path. So go tohttp://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.And you should see the following output:\nNow click on theTry it Outbutton and enter the data you want the prediction for:\nAfter you've entered all the values click onExecute,after this you can see your output under the responses section:\nAnd as you can see we got our class as the response.

It is difficult to generalize for a model only with help of a single example. There are more chances of errors in the results when the model is trained with one-shot learning.\nZero shot learning:In zero shot learning, the model needs to recognize the classes which were not seen on the training time. It has to find a relationship between seen and unseen classes on the basis of some semantic relations or auxiliary information present.\nN shot learning:In n-shot learning, n number of examples are given to train the model. They are more than one but still less than data required for training insupervised learning. This approach is more reliable for training of a model to get optimized results."

These networks are trained to minimize the distance between similar objects and maximize the distance between different objects. If the output is less than threshold value, the classes are different, else, if the output is equal to or greater than threshold value, the classes are similar.\nModel Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML):It is an approach of meta-learning in which the model is trained to adapt new tasks quickly. The model learns an initialization that is fine tuned by some examples for a specific task. It is hard to train as the method is more complex. It does not work well on the few shot learning classification benchmarks as compared to other metric algorithms.\nPrototypical Networks:In prototype learning, the model learns the prototype of each class based on embedding of its instances. During training, the model minimizes the distance between the embeddings of instances and the prototype for each class. It is an effective measure of implementing few shot learning technique for classification.\nTriplet Networks:It is an extension to the Siamese Network. It consists of triplets of instances, i.e., Anchor, Positive example, Negative example. The model is trained to minimize the difference between anchor and positive example (which is similar to the anchor) and maximize the distance between anchor and negative example (which is different from the anchor).\nMatching Networks:Matching networks starts by looking at support set provided to model. Then, when a new query comes, it pays attention to the most similar class present and compare its similarities and dissimilarities with the query set.

It's a simple approach but it doesn't account for the relationships between variables.\nIn this example, we are explaining the imputation techniques for handling missing values in the 'Marks' column of the DataFrame (df). It calculates and fills missing values with the mean, median and mode of the existing values in that column and then prints the results for observation.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(df['Marks'].mean()): Fills missing values in the 'Marks' column with themeanvalue.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(df['Marks'].median()): Fills missing values in the 'Marks' column with the median value.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(df['Marks'].mode():Fills missing values in the 'Marks' column with themodevalue.\n.iloc[0]:Accesses the first element of the Series which represents the mode.\nOutput:\nAdvantages:\nSimple and efficient:Easy to implement and quick.\nWorks well with numerical data:It is useful for numerical variables with a normal distribution.\nDisadvantages:\nInaccuracy:It assumes the missing value is similar to the central tendency (mean/median/mode) which may not always be the case.\n2.2 Forward and Backward Fill\nForward and backward fill techniques are used to replace missing values by filling them with the nearest non-missing values from the same column. This is useful when there’s an inherent order or sequence in the data.\nThe method parameter infillna()allows to specify the filling strategy.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(method='ffill'):This method fills missing values in the 'Marks' column of the DataFrame (df) using a forward fill strategy. It replaces missing values with the last observed non-missing value in the column.\ndf['Marks'].fillna(method='bfill'):This method fills missing values in the 'Marks' column using a backward fill strategy. It replaces missing values with the next observed non-missing value in the column.\nOutput:\nAdvantages:\nSimple and Intuitive:Preserves the temporal or sequential order in data.\nPreserves Patterns:Fills missing values logically, especially in time-series or ordered data.\nDisadvantages:\nAssumption of Closeness:Assumes that the missing values are similar to the observed values nearby which may not always be true.\nPotential Inaccuracy:May not work well if there are large gaps between non-missing values."

Containerize ML Models: Package models in containers (e.g., Docker) to ensure they run consistently across environments. Containerization also makes deployment and scaling much simpler.\n7. Implement CI/CD for ML: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for models. Automate testing, validation and deployment so new versions can go live quickly and safely.\n8. Monitor Models in Production: Track metrics like accuracy, latency and prediction quality. Detect data or concept drift early and identify any issues before they impact users.\n9. Enable Automated Retraining: Set up pipelines that automatically retrain models when performance drops or when new data arrives. This keeps models up-to-date and accurate over time.\n10.

In fact, NASA created the technology forautonomous drivingfor Mars Rovers almost a decade ago. A Machine Learning navigation and driving system for self-driving Mars rovers known asAutoNavwas actually used in theSpiritandOpportunityrovers which landed on Mars as early as 2004. Another rover launched in 2011,Curiosityalso uses Autonav and it is a rover that is still exploring Mars to date with the mission of finding water and other factors that might make Mars suitable for human exploration in the future! Now you would think that driving on Mars is comparatively easier than driving on the congested roads of Earth. But it’s not so easy! While AutoNav does not have to worry about the rover hitting other vehicles or humans (There is no life found on Mars yet!), the surface of Mars is very rocky so the navigation system has to make sure that the rover does not hit rocks or slippery sand dunes that would trap it permanently.\nAnother application of Machine Learning in the Mars rovers is an algorithm calledAEGIS(Autonomous Exploration for Gathering Increased Science) which identifies Martian rock formations that might be interesting on their own by using Machine Learning This is because the rover cannot send all the pictures of Mars it snaps back on Earth because there is only limited communication possible. So AEGIS decides which pictures might be interesting or important and then the rover sends them back to Earth for the NASA scientists to study."

These healthcare options will be created by certified doctors and surgeons and they will learn and evolve with time according to the astronaut experiences.\nAll in all, the main aim of the Exploration Medical Capability is that astronauts stay fit and healthy in space (Especially on long and far-away missions). And unlike what comic books tell you about space, some of the common health risks associated with space travel areradiation hazards, harsh environmental challenges, issues due to gravitational changes,etc. In these situations, the astronauts cannot directly contact doctors on Earth as there is a time lag and so the ExMC uses machine learning to provide self-reliant autonomous medical care with the help of remote medical technologies."

This is not science fiction, NASA actually believes we may find aliens one day! But for discovering aliens, NASA first needs to discover more and more new planets in different solar systems. Once theseexoplanetsare discovered, then NASA measures the atmospheric spectrum of these planets to find if there is any possibility of life. While these steps are complicated enough, the problem is that there is no real data available for experimentation! So NASA scientists just generate the required data and that's where Machine Learning comes in. ThePlanetary Spectrum Generatoris a tool that NASA uses to create3-D orbitsandatmospheric propertiesof the exoplanets they find. To create a working model for the solar system, scientists uselinear regressionas well asconvolutional neural networks. Then further fine-tuning is conducted on the model before it is ready for training.\nThe above image demonstrates the results generated for an exoplanet that demonstrate the amount of water and methane in the atmosphere.

This was necessary as it would increase NASA's capacity for research and discovery in space which would, in turn, allow us to learn more about the solar system and all of this has become easy with machine learning.\n\nAs you can see from this image, Robonaut is now an essential helper in space! To achieve this, Robonaut basically usesMachine Learningto \"think\" for itself. So the scientists or astronauts can give tasks to the Robonaut and figures out how to perform them. In general, Robonaut also has many advantages over normal humans likeadvanced sensors, insanely high speeds, compact design,and muchhigher flexibility.

Currently, theNASA Frontier Development Labis working on a project to provide navigation on the surface of celestial bodies including the moon! This project basically aims to provide GPS even on the lunar surface, just without using multiple very expensive satellites! And that is not an easy task keeping in mind the rocky and barren lunar surface:\n\nThis is done by feeding a Machine Learning System lots of images of the moon(2.4 million in this case which luckily NASA already has!)and then creating a virtual version of the moon using neural networks. Then if you are lost on the Moon, you can take images of your surroundings and the Machine Learning System will be able to triangulate your location on the moon by comparing your images with the already created image database of the lunar surface that constitutes the virtual moon. While this technique isn't perfect (yet!), it is still much better than anything already available and can be used on any planetary surface, not just the moon.

Instead of giving a computer step-by-step instructions for every task, we give it lots of data and let it learn patterns and rules from that data. For example, if we want a computer to recognize photos of cats, we don’t have to tell it what a cat looks like. Instead, we show it many pictures of cats and non-cats. Over time, the computer learns the difference and can say, “This is a cat!” when it sees a new photo.\nMachine Learning is used in many everyday things like voice assistants (like Siri or Alexa), online recommendations (like YouTube or Amazon), and even self-driving cars. It’s all about helping machines get smarter over time by learning from the data they see."

Feedback is provided to correct the error \"Wrong! It's an apple\" and the system updates its model based on this feedback.\nOver time it learns to respond correctly that \"It's an apple\" when getting similar inputs and also improves accuracy.\nBesides these three main types, modern machine learning also includes two other important approaches:Self-Supervised LearningandSemi-Supervised Learning."

    "input": "Brief Summary of Linear Regression",
    "output": "Linear Regression is a very common statistical method that allows us to learn a function or relationship from a given set of continuous data. For example, we are given some data points of x and corresponding y and we need to learn the relationship between them which is called ahypothesis.\nIn the case of Linear regression, the hypothesis is a straight line, i.e,h(x) = wx + bWhere w is a vector calledWeightsand b is a scalar calledBias. The Weights and Bias are called theparametersof the model.\nAll we need to do is estimate the value of w and b from the given set of data such that the resultant hypothesis produces the least cost J which is defined by the followingcost functionJ(w, b) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - h(x_i)) ^ 2where m is the number of data points in the given dataset. This cost function is also calledMean Squared Error.\nFor finding the optimized value of the parameters for which J is minimum, we will be using a commonly used optimizer algorithm calledGradient Descent. Following is the pseudo-code for Gradient Descent:\nRepeat until Convergence {    w = w - α * δJ/δw    b = b - α * δJ/δb}where α is ahyperparametercalled theLearning Rate.\nLinear regression is a widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. TensorFlow is a popular open-source software library for data processing, machine learning, and deep learning applications. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using Tensorflow for linear regression:\nAdvantages:\nScalability:Tensorflow is designed to handle large datasets and can easily scale up to handle more data and more complex models.Flexibility: Tensorflow provides a flexible API that allows users to customize their models and optimize their algorithms.Performance: Tensorflow can run on multiple GPUs and CPUs, which can significantly speed up the training process and improve performance.Integration:Tensorflow can be integrated with other open-source libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which makes it easier to preprocess and visualize data.\nDisadvantages:\nComplexity: Tensorflow has a steep learning curve and requires a good understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts.Computational resources: Running Tensorflow on large datasets requires high computational resources, which can be expensive.Debugging: Debugging errors in Tensorflow can be challenging, especially when working with complex models.Overkill for simple models: Tensorflow can be overkill for simple linear regression models and may not be necessary for smaller datasets.Overall, using Tensorflow for linear regression has many advantages, but it also has some disadvantages. When deciding whether to use Tensorflow or not, it is essential to consider the complexity of the model, the size of the dataset, and the available computational resources."

These coefficients establish the decision boundary that divides the classes. Because of its ease of use, interpretability, and versatility across multiple domains, Logistic Regression is widely used in machine learning for problems that involve binary outcomes.

The data is divided into testing (X_test, y_test) and training (X_train, y_train) sets. Twenty percent of the data will be used for testing, according to the setting test_size=0.2.

The adjacency matrix can be built in the following manners:\nEpsilon-neighbourhood Graph:A parameter epsilon is fixed beforehand. Then, each point is connected to all the points which lie in its epsilon-radius. If all the distances between any two points are similar in scale then typically the weights of the edges ie the distance between the two points are not stored since they do not provide any additional information. Thus, in this case, the graph built is an undirected and unweighted graph.\nK-Nearest NeighboursA parameter k is fixed beforehand. Then, for two vertices u and v, an edge is directed from u to v only if v is among the k-nearest neighbours of u. Note that this leads to the formation of a weighted and directed graph because it is not always the case that for each u having v as one of the k-nearest neighbours, it will be the same case for v having u among its k-nearest neighbours. To make this graph undirected, one of the following approaches is followed:-Direct an edge from u to v and from v to u if either v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uORu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.Direct an edge from u to v and from v to u if v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uANDu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.Fully-Connected Graph:To build this graph, each point is connected with an undirected edge-weighted by the distance between the two points to every other point. Since this approach is used to model the local neighbourhood relationships thus typically the Gaussian similarity metric is used to calculate the distance.\nDirect an edge from u to v and from v to u if either v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uORu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.\nDirect an edge from u to v and from v to u if v is among the k-nearest neighbours of uANDu is among the k-nearest neighbours of v.\nFully-Connected Graph:To build this graph, each point is connected with an undirected edge-weighted by the distance between the two points to every other point. Since this approach is used to model the local neighbourhood relationships thus typically the Gaussian similarity metric is used to calculate the distance.\nProjecting the data onto a lower Dimensional Space:This step is done to account for the possibility that members of the same cluster may be far away in the given dimensional space. Thus the dimensional space is reduced so that those points are closer in the reduced dimensional space and thus can be clustered together by a traditional clustering algorithm. It is done by computing theGraph Laplacian Matrix.\nTo compute it though first, the degree of a node needs to be defined. The degree of the ith node is given byd_{i} = \\sum _{j=1|(i, j)\\epsilon E}^{n} w_{ij}Note thatw_{ij}is the edge between the nodes i and j as defined in the adjacency matrix above.\nThe degree matrix is defined as follows:-D_{ij} = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} d_{i}, i=j & \\\\0, i\\neq j & \\end{matrix}\\right.\nThus the Graph Laplacian Matrix is defined as:-L = D-A\nThis Matrix is then normalized for mathematical efficiency. To reduce the dimensions, first, the eigenvalues and the respective eigenvectors are calculated. If the number of clusters is k then the first eigenvalues and their eigenvectors are taken and stacked into a matrix such that the eigenvectors are the columns.\nCode For Calculating eigenvalues and eigenvector of the matrix in Python\n\nClustering the Data:This process mainly involves clustering the reduced data by using any traditional clustering technique - typically K-Means Clustering. First, each node is assigned a row of the normalized of the Graph Laplacian Matrix. Then this data is clustered using any traditional technique. To transform the clustering result, the node identifier is retained.\nProperties:"

    "output": "There are several concepts related to support vector regression (SVR) that you may want to understand in order to use it effectively. Here are a few of the most important ones:\nSupport vector machines (SVMs):SVR is a type ofsupport vector machine(SVM), a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. SVMs try to find the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates different classes or output values.\nKernels:SVR can use different types of kernels, which are functions that determine the similarity between input vectors. A linear kernel is a simple dot product between two input vectors, while a non-linear kernel is a more complex function that can capture more intricate patterns in the data. The choice of kernel depends on the data's characteristics and the task's complexity.\nHyperparameters:SVR has severalhyperparametersthat you can adjust to control the behavior of the model. For example, the'C'parameter controls the trade-off between the insensitive loss and the sensitive loss. A larger value of'C'means that the model will try to minimize the insensitive loss more, while a smaller value of C means that the model will be more lenient in allowing larger errors.\nModel evaluation:Like anymachine learningmodel, it's important to evaluate the performance of an SVR model. One common way to do this is to split the data into a training set and a test set, and use the training set to fit the model and the test set to evaluate it. You can then use metrics likemean squared error (MSE)ormean absolute error (MAE)to measure the error between the predicted and true output values."

Each time we feed in data, they learn and add the data to their knowledge which is training data.

The Q-function estimates the expected reward of taking a particular action in a given state.\nSARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):SARSA is another model-free RL algorithm that learns a Q-function. However, unlike Q-learning, SARSA updates the Q-function for the action that was actually taken, rather than the optimal action.\nDeep Q-learning:Deep Q-learning is a combination of Q-learning and deep learning.

    "output": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) building blocks include all the aspects that power learning and empower agents to make wise judgements in their surroundings. Effective learning frameworks are produced by the cooperative interactions of these elements. The following are the essential elements:\nAgent: The decision-maker or learner who engages with the environment. The agent acts in accordance with its policy and gains experience over time to improve its ability to make decisions.\nEnvironment: The system outside of the agent that it communicates with. Based on the actions the agent does, it gives the agent feedback in the form of incentives or punishments.\nState: A depiction of the current circumstance or environmental state at a certain moment. The agent chooses its activities and makes decisions based on the state.\nAction: A choice the agent makes that causes a change in the state of the system. The policy of the agent guides the selection of actions.Reward: A scalar feedback signal from the environment that shows whether an agent's behaviour in a specific state is desirable. The agent is guided by rewards to learn positive behaviour.\\\nPolicy: A plan that directs the agent's decision-making by mapping states to actions. Finding an ideal policy that maximises cumulative rewards is the objective.\nValue Function: This function calculates the anticipated cumulative reward an agent can obtain from a specific state while adhering to a specific policy. It is beneficial in assessing and contrasting states and policies.\nModel: A depiction of the dynamics of the environment that enables the agent to simulate potential results of actions and states. Models are useful for planning and forecasting.\nExploration-Exploitation Strategy: A method of making decisions that strikes a balance between exploring new actions to learn more and exploiting well-known acts to reap immediate benefits (exploitation).\nLearning Algorithm:The process by which the agent modifies its value function or policy in response to experiences gained from interacting with the environment. Learning in DRL is fueled by a variety of algorithms, including Q-learning, policy gradient, and actor-critic.\nDeep Neural Networks:DRL can handle high-dimensional state and action spaces by acting as function approximators in deep neural networks. They pick up intricate input-to-output mappings.\nExperience Replay:A method that randomly selects from stored prior experiences (state, action, reward, and next state) during training. As a result, learning stability is improved and the association between subsequent events is decreased.\nThese core components collectively form the foundation ofDeep Reinforcement Learning, empowering agents to learn strategies, make intelligent decisions, and adapt to dynamic environments."

This breakthrough heralded a new era in which DRL could perform difficult tasks by directly learning from unprocessed sensory inputs.\nThrough the years, scientists have made considerable strides in solving these problems. Policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and Trust Region Policy Optimisation (TRPO) provide learning stability. Actor-critical architectures integrate policy- and value-based strategies for increased convergence. The application of distributional reinforcement learning and multi-step bootstrapping techniques has increased learning effectiveness and stability.\nIn order to accelerate learning, researchers are investigating methods to incorporate prior knowledge into DRL algorithms. By dividing challenging tasks into smaller subtasks, reinforcement in hierarchical learning increases learning effectiveness. DRL uses pre-trained models to encourage fast learning in unfamiliar scenarios, bridging the gap between simulations and real-world situations.\nThe use of model-based and model-free hybrid approaches is growing. By developing a model of the environment to guide decision-making, model-based solutions aim to increase sampling efficiency. Two exploration tactics that try to more successfully strike a balance between exploration and exploitation are curiosity-driven exploration and intrinsic motivation."

Smaller layers reduce redundancy and allows efficient encoding.\nRegularization: Techniques likeL1 or L2 regularizationadd penalty terms to the loss function. This prevents overfitting by removing excessively large weights which helps in ensuring the model to learns general and useful representations.\nDenoising:In denoising autoencodersrandom noise is added to the input during training. It learns to remove this noise during reconstruction which helps it focus on core, noise-free features and helps in improving robustness.\nTuning the Activation Functions: Adjusting activation functions can promote sparsity by activating only a few neurons at a time.

Padding involves adding extra pixels around the border of the input feature map before convolution.\nThis can be done in two ways:\nValid Padding: In the valid padding, no padding is added to the input feature map, and the output feature map is smaller than the input feature map. This is useful when we want to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\nSame Padding: In the same padding, padding is added to the input feature map such that the size of the output feature map is the same as the input feature map. This is useful when we want to preserve the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.\nThe number of pixels to be added for padding can be calculated based on the size of the kernel and the desired output of the feature map size. The most common padding value is zero-padding, which involves adding zeros to the borders of the input feature map.\nPadding can help in reducing the loss of information at the borders of the input feature map and can improve the performance of the model. However, it also increases the computational cost of the convolution operation. Overall, padding is an important technique in CNNs that helps in preserving the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and can improve the performance of the model."

Thus, the image shrinks every time a convolution operation is performed. This places an upper limit to the number of times such an operation could be performed before the image reduces to nothing thereby precluding us from building deeper networks.\nAlso, the pixels on the corners and the edges are used much less than those in the middle.For example,\nClearly, pixel A is touched in just one convolution operation and pixel B is touched in 3 convolution operations, while pixel C is touched in 9 convolution operations. In general, pixels in the middle are used more often than pixels on corners and edges. Consequently, the information on the borders of images is not preserved as well as the information in the middle."

It takes two inputs:\nRandom Noise (z): A vector of random values that adds diversity to generated outputs.\nConditioning Information (y): Extra data like labels or context that guides what the generator produces for example a class label such as \"cat\" or \"dog\".\nThe generator combines the noise and the conditioning information to produce realistic data that matches the given condition. For example if the condition y is \"cat\" the generator will create an image of a cat.\n2. Discriminator in CGANs: The discriminator is a binary classifier that decides whether input data is real or fake. It also receives two inputs:\nReal Data (x): Actual samples from the dataset.\nConditioning Information (y): The same condition given to the generator.\nUsing both the real/fake data and the condition, the discriminator learns to judge if the data is genuine and if it matches the condition. For example if the input is an image labeled \"cat\" the discriminator verifies whether it truly looks like a real cat.\n3. Interaction Between Generator and Discriminator: The generator and discriminator train together through adversarial training:\nThe generator tries to create fake data based on noise (z) and condition (y) that can fool the discriminator.\nThe discriminator attempts to correctly classify real vs. fake data considering the condition (y).\nThe goal of the adversarial process is:\nGenerator: Produce data that the discriminator believes is real.\nDiscriminator: Accurately distinguish between real and fake data.\n4. Loss Function and Training:Training is guided by a loss function that balances the generator and discriminator:\nmin_G max_D V(D,G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{data} (x)}[logD(x|y)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_{z}}(z)[log(1- D(G(z∣y)))]\nThe first term encourages the discriminator to classify real samples correctly.\nThe second term pushes the generator to produce samples that the discriminator classifies as real.\nHere\\mathbb{E}represents the expected valuep_{data}is the real data distribution andp_{z}is the prior noise distribution.\nAs training progresses both the generator and discriminator improve.

Let's first calculate the Jacobian of the hidden layer:\n\\begin{aligned}Z_j &= W_i X_i \\\\ h_j &= \\phi(Z_j)\\end{aligned}\nwhere \\phi is non-linearity.

An essential factor enabling the training of such a deep network is the use of skip connections (also known as shortcut connections). The signal that enters a layer is added to the output of a layer located higher up in the stack. Let's explore why this is beneficial.\nWhen training a neural network, the goal is to make it replicate a target function h(x). By adding the input x to the output of the network (a skip connection), the network is made to model f(x) = h(x) - x, a technique known as residual learning.\nWhen initializing a regular neural network, its weights are near zero, resulting in the network outputting values close to zero. With the addition of skip connections, the resulting network outputs a copy of its inputs, effectively modeling the identity function. This can be beneficial if the target function is similar to the identity function, as it will accelerate training. Furthermore, if multiple skip connections are added, the network can begin to make progress even if several layers have not yet begun learning.\nthe target function is fairly close to the identity function (which is often the case), this will speed up training considerably. Moreover, if you add many skin connections, the network can start making progress even if several\nThe deep residual network can be viewed as a series of residual units, each of which is a small neural network with a skip connection"

This design principle was developed to address the issue of accuracy decline caused by the vanishing and exploding gradients in high-level neural networks.\nAll convolutions in a dense block are ReLU-activated and use batch normalization. Channel-wise concatenation is only possible if the height and width dimensions of the data remain unchanged, so convolutions in a dense block are all of stride 1. Pooling layers are inserted between dense blocks for further dimensionality reduction.\nIntuitively, one might think that by concatenating all previously seen outputs, the number of channels and parameters would exponentially increase. However, DenseNet is surprisingly economical in terms of learnable parameters. This is because each concatenated block, which may have a relatively large number of channels, is first fed through a 1x1 convolution, reducing it to a small number of channels. Additionally, 1x1 convolutions are economical in terms of parameters. Then, a 3x3 convolution with the same number of channels is applied.\nThe resulting channels from each step of the DenseNet are concatenated to the collection of all previously generated outputs. Each step, which utilizes a pair of 1x1 and 3x3 convolutions, adds K channels to the data. Consequently, the number of channels increases linearly with the number of convolutional steps in the dense block. The growth rate remains constant throughout the network, and DenseNet has demonstrated good performance with K values between 12 and 40.\nDense blocks and pooling layers are combined to form a Tu DenseNet network.

They are designed to discover and learn patterns within large sets of data automatically. Imagine them as multi-layered networks, where each layer is capable of making sense of the information received from the previous one, gradually building up a complex understanding of the overall data.\nDBNs are composed of multiple layers of stochastic, or randomly determined, units. These units are known asRestricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)or other similar structures. Each layer in a DBN aims to extract different features from the input data, with lower layers identifying basic patterns and higher layers recognizing more abstract concepts. This structure allows DBNs to effectively learn complex representations of data, which makes them particularly useful for tasks like image and speech recognition, where the input data is high-dimensional and requires a deep level of understanding.\nThe architecture of DBNs also makes them good atunsupervised learning, where the goal is to understand and label input data without explicit guidance. This characteristic is particularly useful in scenarios where labelled data is scarce or when the goal is to explore the structure of the data without any preconceived labels."

During this phase, the network learns the probability distribution of the inputs, which helps it understand the underlying structure of the data.\nIn the fine-tuning phase, the DBN adjusts its parameters for a specific task, like classification or regression. This is typically done using a technique known as backpropagation, where the network’s performance on a task is evaluated, and the errors are used to update the network’s parameters. This phase often involves supervised learning, where the network is trained with labelled data."

At their core, they use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for layer-wise learning, which are based on probabilistic graphical models.\n1.    Energy-Based Model:Each RBM within a DBN is an energy-based model. For an RBM with visible units v and hidden units h, the energy function is defined as:\nE(v,h) = -\\sum _{i}a_i v_i - \\sum _j b_j h_j - \\sum _{i,j} v_j h_j w_{ij}\nHere, ai and bj are bias terms, and wij represents the weights between units.\n2. Probability Distribution:The probability of a given state of the RBM is defined by the Boltzmann distribution:\nP(v,h) = \\frac{e^{-E(v,h)}}{Z}\nwhere Z is the partition function, a normalization factor calculated as the sum over all possible pairs of visible and hidden units.\n3. Training using Contrastive Divergence:RBMs are typically trained using a method called Contrastive Divergence (CD). This method approximates the gradient of the log-likelihood and updates the weights wij, and biases ai,bj to maximize the likelihood of the training data under the model.\nIn a DBN, these RBMs are stacked. The hidden layer of one RBM serves as the visible layer for the next. After this unsupervised, layer-wise training, the entire network can be fine-tuned using supervised methods like backpropagation, where the goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual label of the training data."

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\nImport Libraries:Essential Python libraries for data handling (numpy, pandas), machine learning models (scikit-learn), and deep learning (tensorflow) are imported.\nLoad Dataset:The MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, is fetched using fetch_openml from scikit-learn. This dataset is commonly used for benchmarking classification algorithms.\nPreprocessing:The dataset is split into training and testing sets with train_test_split. The data is then scaled using StandardScaler to normalize it, which often leads to better performance for neural networks.\nRBM Layer:A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is initialized with a specified number of components and learning rate. RBMs are unsupervised neural networks that find patterns in data by reconstructing the inputs.\nClassifier Layer:A logistic regression classifier is chosen for the final prediction layer. Logistic regression is a simple yet effective linear model for classification tasks.\nDBN Pipeline:The RBM and logistic regression model are chained together in a Pipeline. This allows for sequential application of the RBM (for feature extraction) followed by logistic regression (for classification).\nTraining:The pipeline, which forms the DBN, is trained on the preprocessed training data (X_train_scaled). The RBM learns features that are then used by the logistic regression model to classify the digits.\nEvaluation:Finally, the trained DBN's performance is evaluated on the test set. The classification accuracy (dbn_score) is printed to provide a quantitative measure of how well the model performs.\nThis DBN implementation leverages a simple but effective stack of models to learn from the data and perform digit classification. The RBM layers act as feature detectors, converting raw pixel intensities into more useful representations for the logistic regression model to classify.\nOutput:\nThe output shows the training progress of a Deep Belief Network (DBN) over 20 iterations. During each iteration, the RBM part of the DBN is learning to understand the structure of the data. The \"pseudo-likelihood\" is a measure used to estimate how well the RBM is modeling the data. However, the values given are negative and increasing in magnitude, which typically should not happen as we expect the pseudo-likelihood to increase (or loss to decrease) as the model learns.\nAfter training, the DBN achieves a classification score of about 21.14%. This score is a way of measuring accuracy; it tells us that the DBN correctly predicted the digit class 21.14% of the time on the test dataset. This is not a very high score, suggesting the model didn't perform well in this task."

    "input": "Conclusion",
    "output": "The article provided a walkthrough on setting up a Deep Belief Network (DBN), a type of advanced computer program designed to recognize patterns in data. We used handwritten digits as an example. The DBN was trained using a method that involved learning from the data in stages, with each stage hoping to get better at spotting the various digits.\nHowever, the training updates showed a peculiar trend where the model's estimation of doing a good job (pseudo-likelihood) kept getting worse. Ideally, this number should get better as the model sees more data. After the training, when the DBN was tested to see how well it could identify new handwritten digits, it only got it right about 21% of the time. This score is quite low, suggesting that the DBN didn't learn as effectively as we would have liked.\nIn simple terms, it's like the DBN was a student who, despite studying more, wasn't getting better at passing tests. This outcome suggests that the DBN might need a different study strategy, perhaps a change in how it learns from the data or the kind of data it learns from. To improve its performance, we might need to adjust the training process or try different ways of teaching the DBN about handwritten digits."

A decoder does the opposite - it takes that special format and turns it back into the original information. Think of them like a secret code. The encoder writes the message in code, and the decoder reads the code to understand the message. This is useful because sometimes the coded version is smaller or safer to send.\nFor example when you send a picture online, an encoder might make the file smaller so it sends faster. Then, a decoder on the other end turns it back into a picture you can see. Without encoders and decoders, many things we do with computers and phones would be much harder or slower."

Additionally, it initializes a running sum of squared gradients for each parameter which will track the gradients over time.\n2. Gradient Calculation:For each training step, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters is calculated, just like in standard gradient descent.\n3. Adaptive Learning Rate:The key difference comes next. Instead of using a fixed learning rate, Adagrad adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the accumulated sum of squared gradients.\nThe updated learning rate for each parameter is calculated as follows:\nWhere:\n\\etais the global learning rate (a small constant value)\nG_t​ is the sum of squared gradients for a given parameter up to time stept\nϵis a small value added to avoid division by zero (often set to1e−8)\nHere, the denominator\\sqrt{G_t + \\epsilon}​ grows as the squared gradients accumulate, causing the learning rate to decrease over time which helps to stabilize the training.\n4. Parameter Update:The model's parameters are updated by subtracting the product of the adaptive learning rate and the gradient at each step:\nWhere:\n\\theta_t​ is the current parameter\n\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameter"

Use MSE or MAE for regression, Cross-Entropy for classification, Contrastive or Triplet Loss for ranking and Dice or Jaccard Loss for image segmentation.\nConsider the Output Type: You should also think about the type of output your model produces. If the output is a continuous number use regression loss functions like MSE or MAE, classification losses for labels and CTC Loss for sequence outputs like speech or handwriting.\nHandle Imbalanced Data: If your dataset is imbalanced  one class appears much more often than others it's important to use a loss function that can handle this. Focal Loss is useful for such cases because it focuses more on the harder-to-predict or rare examples and help the model learn better from them.\nRobust to Outliers: When your data has outliers it’s better to use a loss function that’s less sensitive to them. Huber Loss is a good option because it combines the strengths of both MSE and MAE and make it more robust and stable when outliers are present.\nPerformance and Convergence: Choose loss functions that help your model converge faster and perform better. For example using Hinge Loss for SVMs can sometimes lead to better performance than Cross-Entropy for classification.\nLoss function helps in evaluation and optimization. Understanding different types of loss functions and their applications is important for designing effective deep learning models."

    "input": "1. Supervised Models",

    "input": "1.1 Classification",
    "output": "The classifier algorithms are designed to indicate whether a new data point belongs to one or another among several predefined classes. Imagine when you are organising emails into spam or inbox, categorising images as cat or dog, or predicting whether a loan applicant is a credible borrower. In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes. After learning these patterns, the model is then capable of assigning these class labels to unseen data points.\nCommon Classification Algorithms:\nLogistic Regression:A very efficient technique for the classification problems of binary nature (two types, for example, spam/not spam).\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM):Good for tasks like classification, especially when the data has a large number of features.\nDecision Tree:Constructs a decision tree having branches and proceeds to the class predictions through features.\nRandom Forest:The model generates an \"ensemble\" of decision trees that ultimately raise the accuracy and avoid overfitting (meaning that the model performs great on the training data but lousily on unseen data).\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):Assigns a label of the nearest neighbors for a given data point."

This value could be anything such as predicting real estate prices or stock market trends to anticipating customer churn (how likely customers stay) and sales forecasting. Regression models make the use of features to understand the relationship among the continuous features and the output variable. That is, they use the pattern that is learned to determine the value of the new data points.\nCommon Regression Algorithms\nLinear Regression:Fits depth of a line to the data to model for the relationship between features and the continuous output.\nPolynomial Regression:Similiar to linear regression but uses more complex polynomial functions such as quadratic, cubic, etc, for accommodating non-linear relationships of the data.\nDecision Tree Regression:Implements a decision tree-based algorithm that predicts a continuous output variable from a number of branching decisions.\nRandom Forest Regression:Creates one from several decision trees to guarantee error-free and robust regression prediction results.\nSupport Vector Regression (SVR):Adjusts the Support Vector Machine ideas for regression tasks, where we are trying to find one hyperplane that most closely reflects continuous output data."

Techniques like K-means clustering are defined by exact number of clusters (\"red fruits\" and \"green fruits\") and then each data point (fruit) is assigned to the cluster with the highest similarity within based on features (color, size, texture). Contrary to this, hierarchical clustering features construction of hierarchy of clusters which makes it more easy to study the system of groups. Spatial clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) detects groups of high-density data points, even in those areas where there is a lack of data or outliers."

The purpose of dimensionality reduction methods is to decrease the dimensions needed to maintain the key features. Dimensions of greatest importance are identified byprincipal component analysis (PCA), which is the reason why data is concentrated in fewer dimensions with the highest variations. This speeds up model training as well as offers a chance for more efficient visualization. LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) also resembles PCA but it is made for classification tasks where it concentrates on dimensions that can differentiate the present classes in the dataset."

    "input": "2.3Anomaly Detection",
    "output": "Unsupervised learning can also be applied to find those data points which greatly differ than the majorities. The statistics model may identify these outliers, or anomalies as signaling of errors, fraud or even something unusual. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) makes a comparison of a given data point's local density with those surrounding it. It then flags out the data points with significantly lower densities as outliers or potential anomalies. Isolation Forest is the one which uses different approach, which is to recursively isolate data points according to their features. Anomalies usually are simple to contemplate as they often necessitate fewer steps than an average normal point."

It exploits a generative model to investigate the unlabeled pictures and discover the orchestrating factors that characterize the data. This technique can then be used to generate the new synthetic data points that have the same features with the unlabeled data. The synthetic data is then labeled with the pseudo-labels that the generative model has interpreted from the data. This approach combines the existing labeled data with the newly generated labeled data to train the final model which is likely to perform better than the previous model that was trained with only the limited amount of the original labeled data."

Cluster-based methods can analyze the links between users (friendships) and even apply this information to infer that if a user is connected to someone with a \"sports\" label then this user might also be interested in sports (unbiased labels with propagated label). While links and the entire structure of the network are also important for the distribution of labels.

The main purpose is to help players play the game that can result in the highest rewards."

It has neither a map nor instructions, but it gets points for consuming the cheese at the end and fails with deduction of time when it runs into a wall. Value learning is an offshoot of predicting the anticipated future reward of taking a step in a particular state. For example, the algorithm Q-learning will learn a Q-value for each state-action combination. This Q-value is the expected reward for that action at that specific state. Through a repetitive process of assessing the state, gaining rewards, and updating the Q-values the agent manages to determine that which actions are most valuable in each state and eventually guides it to the most rewarding path. In contrast,SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)looks at the value of the succeeding state-action pair that influences the exploration strategy."

  {
    "input": "4.2 Policy-based learning:",
    "output": "In contrast to the value-based learning, where we are learning a specific value for each state-action pair, in policy-based learning we are trying to directly learn a policy which maps states to actions. This policy in essence commands the agent to act in different situations as specified by the way it is written. Actor-Critic is a common approach that combines two models: an actor that retrains the policy and a critic that retrains the value function (just like value-based methods). The actor witnesses the critic's feedback which updates the policy that the actor uses for better decision making. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a specific policy-based method which focuses on high variance issues that complicate early policy-based learning methods."

    "input": "Can Human Translators be replaced by AI?",
    "output": "Challenges arise as different languages categorize and express concepts in diverse ways, demanding careful consideration in translation. The use of an interlingua, a representation language capturing distinctions among languages, becomes essential. Whether undertaken by humans or machines, effective translation involves grasping the entirety of the scenario presented in the source, not just individual words. Complexities further intensify when dealing with cultural and grammatical nuances, underscoring the intricacies of the translation endeavor.\nIt can be challenging for translators (both machine and human) to make this decision. \"The baseball struck the window,\" for example, maybe translated as \"The baseball hit the window.\" In order to translate \"it broke\" into French, we must pick between the feminine \"elle\" and the masculine \"il,\" indicating whether \"it\" refers to the baseball or the window. To get the translation properly, you'll need to know both physics and language.\nWhile AI and machine translation systems continue to improve, the goal should be seen as augmentation rather than replacement. Many applications benefit from a collaborative approach where AI tools assist human translators in their work, improving efficiency and consistency. The human touch remains crucial for nuanced, accurate, and culturally sensitive translations."

    "input": "Advantages",

Each step requires fewer computations, leading to quicker convergence.\nMemory Efficiency: Since it does not require storing the entire dataset in memory for each iteration, SGD can handle much larger datasets than traditional gradient descent.\nEscaping Local Minima: The noisy updates in SGD, caused by the stochastic nature of the algorithm, can help the model escape local minima or saddle points, potentially leading to better solutions in non-convex optimization problems.\nOnline Learning: SGD is well-suited for online learning where the model is trained incrementally as new data comes in, rather than on a static dataset."
  },
  {
    "input": "Challenges",
    "output": "Noisy Convergence: Since the gradient is estimated based on a single data point (or a small batch), the updates can be noisy, causing the cost function to fluctuate rather than steadily decrease. This makes convergence slower and more erratic than in batch gradient descent.\nLearning Rate Tuning: SGD is highly sensitive to the choice of learning rate. A learning rate that is too large may cause the algorithm to diverge while one that is too small can slow down convergence. Adaptive methods like Adam and RMSprop address this by adjusting the learning rate dynamically during training.\nLong Training Times: While each individual update is fast, the convergence might take a longer time overall since the steps are more erratic compared to batch gradient descent."

The loss function could vary; common choices are mean squared error for regression tasks or cross-entropy loss for classification.\nGradient Calculation:The network computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network. This involves applying the chain rule of calculus to find out how much each part of the output error can be attributed to each weight and bias.\nWeight Update:Once the gradients are calculated, the weights and biases are updated using an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
